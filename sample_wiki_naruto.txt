akatsuki figurehead leader  nagato  kills jiraiya and devastates konoha  but naruto defeats and redeems him  earning the village s respect and admiration   with nagato s death  tobi  disguised as

the sixth hokage and pardons sasuke for his crimes  years later  kakashi steps down while naruto marries hinata hyuga and becomes the seventh hokage  raising the next generation   production development in 1995  shueisha released karakuri  a one shot manga by masashi kishimoto that earned an honorable mention in the hop step award in 1996  kishimoto was unsatisfied with his subsequent drafts for a follow up  and decided to work on another project  4  the new project was originally going to feature naruto as a chef  but this version never made it to print  kishimoto originally wanted to make naruto a child who could transform into a fox  so he created a one shot of naruto for the summer 1997 issue of akamaru jump based on the idea  5  6  despite the positive feedback it received in a readers  poll  kishimoto was unhappy with the art and the story  so he rewrote it as a story about ninjas  7   the first eight chapters of naruto were planned before it appeared in weekly sh nen jump  and these chapters originally devoted many panels of intricate art to illustrating the konoha village  by the time naruto debuted  the background art was sparse  instead emphasizing the characters  7  though kishimoto had concerns that chakra  the energy source used by the ninjas in naruto  made the series too japanese  he still believed it is an enjoyable read  8  kishimoto is a fan of godzilla  and the tailed beasts mythology was introduced because kishimoto wanted an excuse to draw monsters  9  he has said that the central theme in part i of naruto is how people accept each other  citing naruto s development across the series as an example  10   for part ii of the manga  kishimoto tried to keep the panel layouts and the plot easy for the reader to follow  and avoid  overdo ing  the typical manga style   11  he considers that his drawing style has changed from  the classic manga look to something a bit more realistic   11  because of wishing to end the arc involving sasuke uchiha search for his brother  itachi  in a single volume  kishimoto decided that volume 43 should include more chapters than regular volumes  as a result  kishimoto apologized to readers for this since volume 43 was more expensive than regular volumes  12   characters main article  list of naruto characters when he created naruto  kishimoto looked to other sh nen manga as influences for his work and tried to make his characters unique  while basing the story on japanese culture  13  the separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a particular flavor  kishimoto wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in one skill and be talentless in another  14  he found it difficult to write about romance  but emphasized it more in part ii of the manga  beginning with volume 28  10  he introduced villains into the story to have them act as a counterpoint to his characters  moral values and clearly illustrate their differences  15  as a result of how the younger characters were significantly weaker than the villains  kishimoto made the ellipsis in order to have them age and become stronger during this time  16   setting kishimoto made use of the chinese zodiac tradition  which had a long standing presence in japan  the zodiac hand signs originate from this  8  when kishimoto was creating the primary setting of the naruto manga  he concentrated initially on the designs for the village of konoha  the idea of the setting came to him  pretty spontaneously without much thought   but admits that the scenery became based on his home in the japanese prefecture of okayama prefecture  since the storyline does not specify when it is set  he was able to include modern elements in the series such as convenience stores  17  he considered including automobiles  planes and simple computers  but excluded projectile weapons and vehicles from the plot  17  18   conclusion when serialization began  kishimoto decided the ending would feature a fight between two characters  naruto and sasuke  however  the writer felt the two were not equals as the former was not a victim of war like the latter whose family was killed to stop a possible civil war  19  nagato s arc paved the way for the ending of naruto to occur  nagato stood out as a villain due to suffering war and killing naruto s mentor jiraiya  understanding the fears of war  naruto s characterization was made more complex for him to experience the fourth great shinobi war  these events end with naruto forgiving sasuke as he had forgiven nagato in the final battle  16   kishimoto chose hinata hyuga as naruto s romantic partner from the early stages of the manga  since hinata had always respected and admired naruto even before the series  beginning  and kishimoto felt this meant the two of them could build a relationship  20  when hinata first appeared  kishimoto thought of expanding romantic plotlines  21  22  but decided to leave naruto s maturation through romance as an idea for the film 2014 the last  naruto the movie where he worked alongside screenwriter maruo kyozuka  a writer more skilled at the theme of romance  23   media see also  list of naruto media manga main article  list of naruto volumes naruto was published in shueisha s magazine  weekly sh nen jump from september 21

that the result was a strong storyline  197  198  but carl kimlinger  also writing for ann  suggested that there were too many fights  which slowed down the plot  199  kimlinger liked the character designs  and approved of the fight scenes themselves 199  which also drew positive comments from rik spanjers  who felt that the excitement of the scenes depends on kishimoto s skill in depicting action  199  javier lugo  writing for manga life  agreed  describing the artwork as  dramatic  exciting  and just right for the story he s telling   200   the anime and manga magazine neo described naruto s character as  irksome   but considered that the series   almost sickening addictiveness  was due to the quality of the characterization  201  and in briana lawrence s opinion the growth of the characters gave part ii an adult feel  202  in a review of volume 28 brienza also praised part ii s storyline and characterization  though she commented that not every volume reached a high level of quality  197   the fights across the part ii received praise  most notably naruto s and sasuke s  resulting in major changes into their character arcs  203  204  205  meanwhile  the final battle between these two fighters in the finale earned major praise for the choreography and art provided as well as how in depth the two s personalities were shown in the aftermath  some writers criticized kaguya being the least entertaining villain  making the showdown between naruto and sasuke more appealing as a result  the finale earned nearly perfect scores from both ann and comic book bin  with the latter acclaiming the popularity of the title character  206  207  208   g  it   a professor in the manga department of tokyo polytechnic university  compared the series  development to the manga of dragon ball  saying that both manga present good illustrations of three dimensional body movements that capture the characters  martial arts very well  g  felt readers could empathize with the characters in naruto via their inner monologue during battles  209   the series also influenced the movie scott pilgrim vs  the world with director edgar wright saying he was inspired by how whenever there is a  killer move  in the manga  there is an impact in the background following any technique s usage  210  when the manga ended  multiple authors from the magazine expressed congratulations to kishimoto s work  211  the fight scenes in general earned acclaim for how well written they are  something game developer cyberconnect2 took into account when developing the naruto games  212  213  214  215   anime the naruto anime was listed as the 38th best animated show in ign s top 100 animated series  216  in september 2005  japanese television network tv asahi broadcast a popularity poll based on a nationwide survey in which naruto placed 17th  217  mike hale of the new york times described the series as much better than american animation aimed at children  218  but the animation received some criticism from both the t h e m  anime reviews critics  christina carpenter felt kishimoto s artistic style translated poorly into animation  219  and derrick tucker was also negative  though he felt that at their best  the depictions   left  little to be desired   220  as with the manga  some reviewers  such as theron martin of ann  along with tucker  felt there were too many fight scenes  220  221  though justin rich argued that the fight scenes were the most important and enjoyable element of the show  222  carpenter also commented positively on the characters  though she felt that most were fairly stereotypical  219  hiroshi matsuyama further reflected the anime s 133rd episode to be one of his favorites not only for the action sequences between naruto and sasuke but also the emotional value displayed  223   naruto  shippuden was well reviewed by activeanime s david c  jones who commented that the animation had improved  224  ann noted that the series has a more serious tone and a better balance between comedy and drama than the first anime series  with more interesting digressions from the main plot  225  226  although the pacing for the first episodes was criticised as slow  the delivery and development of the interactions between the characters received positive comments  227  228  writing for the los angeles times  charles solomon ranked shippuden the third best anime on his  top 10   229  in 2011  readers of guinness world records gamer s edition voted naruto as the 29th top video game character of all time  230   themes amy plumb argues that kishimoto s use of references to japanese mythology in naruto is intended to add further layers to the story  kishimoto expects his readers to decode the references  which allows him to avoid direct explanations  one example is itachi  who has three ninja techniques named after shinto deities  tsukiyomi  amaterasu  and susano o  plumb also cites sasuke s clan s heraldic symbol  a fan known as an uchiwa  these fans are used in japanese myths to exorcise evil  by blowing it away  sasuke discovers late in the series that he has the ability to  blow away  the influence of the nine tailed fox on naruto  foxes  kitsune tsuki  are tricksters in japanese mythology  and in some stories  they take over human bodies  plumb comments on the obvious similarities to the nine tail sealed in naruto  and the pranks naruto plays  231   christopher a  born notes that the naruto storyline contains traditional confucian values  and suggests that students who analyse manga such as naruto and bleach will learn more about confucianism than they would from studying its abstract ideas  232  norman melchor robles jr  evaluated the portrayal of both positive and negative ideas in naruto by counting words in the script which were associated with either violence or positive values  he found that a small majority of tagged words were violent  but commented that the portrayal of violence seemed organized to show how positive strategies on the part of the protagonists could overcome the violence  233  sheuo hui gan considers the series to have a set of  traditional ethical values   she also compares the treatment of alienation in naruto  which naruto overcomes by joining his society  to the portrayal of alienation in akira and neon genesis evangelion  where the main characters remain alienated  234   naruto has been described by several critics as a coming of age story  235  236  237  psychologist lawrence c  rubin suggests that the storylines would appeal to readers of any age who have lost loved ones  or are having difficulty finding friends  or who are in other situations shown in the series  235  in yukari fujimoto s view  as the characters mature  they show respect to the adults who have raised and taught them  making it a conservative storyline in comparison to other manga of the same time period such as one piece and air gear  236  rik spanjers sees the difference between sasuke  a loner  and naruto  an optimist  as tragic  arguing that the contrast between the two protagonists  approach to the world is fundamental to the plot   naruto s strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect  while sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge   237  omote tomoyuki points out that there are many comic moments in the story despite the difficulties naruto finds himself in  but the comic elements diminish dramatically over time as naruto grows into a teenager  particularly once part ii begins  sh nen jump began to carry comedies such as gintama and reborn  from 2003 onwards  and in tomoyuki s view this is part of the reason for the change in emphasis  naruto  was not supposed to provide laughter anymore   238   fujimoto argues that the story has overly traditional gender roles  noting        its representations suggest that men are men and women are women and that they differ naturally regarding aptitude and vocation   for example  the girls initially outperform the boys in the ninja academy  but  once the boys get serious  the girls cannot keep pace   fujimoto points out that this does not upset sakura  who is now surpassed by naruto  character development based on female roles  when it does occur  again uses stereotypical roles  tsunade  for example  a middle aged woman with large breasts  is a clear mother figure  and when she teaches sakura to be a medical ninja  which requires special skills possessed only by women  the story reinforces the idea that women only belong on the battlefield as healers  tsunade herself  who is a figure of authority in naruto  is portrayed as ridiculous in a way that men in the same position are not  fujimoto suggests this presentation of women may explain why the female characters are often the most disliked characters among readers of the manga  239    naruto run  naruto run the naruto run  or ninja run  is a running style based on the way the characters run leaning forward with their arms behind their backs  it became popular in 2017  in which many students and groups worldwide have had events to run like naruto characters  especially on anniversaries of the series  240  241  242  243  on june 27  2019  matty roberts posted on facebook a satirical event called  storm area 51  they can t stop all of us  where he wrote  we will all meet up at the area 51 alien center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry  if we naruto run  we can move faster than their bullets  let s see them  aliens   244  this quickly became an internet meme  resulting in nationwide alerts and warnings issued by nevada law enforcement and the u s  air force  245
