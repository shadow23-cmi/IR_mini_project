revenge  as konoha ninjas defeat several akatsuki members  the akatsuki figurehead leader  nagato  kills jiraiya and devastates konoha  but naruto defeats and redeems him  earning the village s

powerful enough to control all humanity and achieve world peace  the leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to help him and instead join forces to confront tobi and his allies  that decision

becomes the seventh hokage  raising the next generation   production development in       shueisha released karakuri  a one shot manga by masashi kishimoto that earned an honorable mention in the hop step award in       kishimoto was unsatisfied with his subsequent drafts for a follow up  and decided to work on another project     the new project was originally going to feature naruto as a chef  but this version never made it to print  kishimoto originally wanted to make naruto a child who could transform into a fox  so he created a one shot of naruto for the summer      issue of akamaru jump based on the idea        despite the positive feedback it received in a readers  poll  kishimoto was unhappy with the art and the story  so he rewrote it as a story about ninjas      the first eight chapters of naruto were planned before it appeared in weekly sh nen jump  and these chapters originally devoted many panels of intricate art to illustrating the konoha village  by the time naruto debuted  the background art was sparse  instead emphasizing the characters     though kishimoto had concerns that chakra  the energy source used by the ninjas in naruto  made the series too japanese  he still believed it is an enjoyable read     kishimoto is a fan of godzilla  and the tailed beasts mythology was introduced because kishimoto wanted an excuse to draw monsters     he has said that the central theme in part i of naruto is how people accept each other  citing naruto s development across the series as an example       for part ii of the manga  kishimoto tried to keep the panel layouts and the plot easy for the reader to follow  and avoid  overdo ing  the typical manga style       he considers that his drawing style has changed from  the classic manga look to something a bit more realistic       because of wishing to end the arc involving sasuke uchiha search for his brother  itachi  in a single volume  kishimoto decided that volume    should include more chapters than regular volumes  as a result  kishimoto apologized to readers for this since volume    was more expensive than regular volumes       characters main article  list of naruto characters when he created naruto  kishimoto looked to other sh nen manga as influences for his work and tried to make his characters unique  while basing the story on japanese culture      the separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a particular flavor  kishimoto wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in one skill and be talentless in another      he found it difficult to write about romance  but emphasized it more in part ii of the manga  beginning with volume         he introduced villains into the story to have them act as a counterpoint to his characters  moral values and clearly illustrate their differences      as a result of how the younger characters were significantly weaker than the villains  kishimoto made the ellipsis in order to have them age and become stronger during this time       setting kishimoto made use of the chinese zodiac tradition  which had a long standing presence in japan  the zodiac hand signs originate from this     when kishimoto was creating the primary setting of the naruto manga  he concentrated initially on the designs for the village of konoha  the idea of the setting came to him  pretty spontaneously without much thought   but admits that the scenery became based on his home in the japanese prefecture of okayama prefecture  since the storyline does not specify when it is set  he was able to include modern elements in the series such as convenience stores      he considered including automobiles  planes and simple computers  but excluded projectile weapons and vehicles from the plot           conclusion when serialization began  kishimoto decided the ending would feature a fight between two characters  naruto and sasuke  however  the writer felt the two were not equals as the former was not a victim of war like the latter whose family was killed to stop a possible civil war      nagato s arc paved the way for the ending of naruto to occur  nagato stood out as a villain due to suffering war and killing naruto s mentor jiraiya  understanding the fears of war  naruto s characterization was made more complex for him to experience the fourth great shinobi war  these events end with naruto forgiving sasuke as he had forgiven nagato in the final battle       kishimoto chose hinata hyuga as naruto s romantic partner from the early stages of the manga  since hinata had always respected and admired naruto even before the series  beginning  and kishimoto felt this meant the two of them could build a relationship      when hinata first appeared  kishimoto thought of expanding romantic plotlines          but decided to leave naruto s maturation through romance as an idea for the film      the last  naruto the movie where he worked alongside screenwriter maruo kyozuka  a writer more skilled at the theme of romance       media see also  list of naruto media manga main article  list of naruto volumes naruto was published in shueisha s magazine  weekly sh nen jump from september

naruto is also a top digital streaming performer on hulu        reception manga several reviewers commented on the balance between fight scenes and plot development  a  e  sparrow of ign and casey brienza of anime news network  ann  felt that the result was a strong storyline            but carl kimlinger  also writing for ann  suggested that there were too many fights  which slowed down the plot       kimlinger liked the character designs  and approved of the fight scenes themselves      which also drew positive comments from rik spanjers  who felt that the excitement of the scenes depends on kishimoto s skill in depicting action       javier lugo  writing for manga life  agreed  describing the artwork as  dramatic  exciting  and just right for the story he s telling         the anime and manga magazine neo described naruto s character as  irksome   but considered that the series   almost sickening addictiveness  was due to the quality of the characterization       and in briana lawrence s opinion the growth of the characters gave part ii an adult feel       in a review of volume    brienza also praised part ii s storyline and characterization  though she commented that not every volume reached a high level of quality        the fights across the part ii received praise  most notably naruto s and sasuke s  resulting in major changes into their character arcs                 meanwhile  the final battle between these two fighters in the finale earned major praise for the choreography and art provided as well as how in depth the two s personalities were shown in the aftermath  some writers criticized kaguya being the least entertaining villain  making the showdown between naruto and sasuke more appealing as a result  the finale earned nearly perfect scores from both ann and comic book bin  with the latter acclaiming the popularity of the title character                  g  it   a professor in the manga department of tokyo polytechnic university  compared the series  development to the manga of dragon ball  saying that both manga present good illustrations of three dimensional body movements that capture the characters  martial arts very well  g  felt readers could empathize with the characters in naruto via their inner monologue during battles        the series also influenced the movie scott pilgrim vs  the world with director edgar wright saying he was inspired by how whenever there is a  killer move  in the manga  there is an impact in the background following any technique s usage       when the manga ended  multiple authors from the magazine expressed congratulations to kishimoto s work       the fight scenes in general earned acclaim for how well written they are  something game developer cyberconnect  took into account when developing the naruto games                       anime the naruto anime was listed as the   th best animated show in ign s top     animated series       in september       japanese television network tv asahi broadcast a popularity poll based on a nationwide survey in which naruto placed   th       mike hale of the new york times described the series as much better than american animation aimed at children       but the animation received some criticism from both the t h e m  anime reviews critics  christina carpenter felt kishimoto s artistic style translated poorly into animation       and derrick tucker was also negative  though he felt that at their best  the depictions   left  little to be desired        as with the manga  some reviewers  such as theron martin of ann  along with tucker  felt there were too many fight scenes            though justin rich argued that the fight scenes were the most important and enjoyable element of the show       carpenter also commented positively on the characters  though she felt that most were fairly stereotypical       hiroshi matsuyama further reflected the anime s    rd episode to be one of his favorites not only for the action sequences between naruto and sasuke but also the emotional value displayed        naruto  shippuden was well reviewed by activeanime s david c  jones who commented that the animation had improved       ann noted that the series has a more serious tone and a better balance between comedy and drama than the first anime series  with more interesting digressions from the main plot            although the pacing for the first episodes was criticised as slow  the delivery and development of the interactions between the characters received positive comments            writing for the los angeles times  charles solomon ranked shippuden the third best anime on his  top           in       readers of guinness world records gamer s edition voted naruto as the   th top video game character of all time        themes amy plumb argues that kishimoto s use of references to japanese mythology in naruto is intended to add further layers to the story  kishimoto expects his readers to decode the references  which allows him to avoid direct explanations  one example is itachi  who has three ninja techniques named after shinto deities  tsukiyomi  amaterasu  and susano o  plumb also cites sasuke s clan s heraldic symbol  a fan known as an uchiwa  these fans are used in japanese myths to exorcise evil  by blowing it away  sasuke discovers late in the series that he has the ability to  blow away  the influence of the nine tailed fox on naruto  foxes  kitsune tsuki  are tricksters in japanese mythology  and in some stories  they take over human bodies  plumb comments on the obvious similarities to the nine tail sealed in naruto  and the pranks naruto plays        christopher a  born notes that the naruto storyline contains traditional confucian values  and suggests that students who analyse manga such as naruto and bleach will learn more about confucianism than they would from studying its abstract ideas       norman melchor robles jr  evaluated the portrayal of both positive and negative ideas in naruto by counting words in the script which were associated with either violence or positive values  he found that a small majority of tagged words were violent  but commented that the portrayal of violence seemed organized to show how positive strategies on the part of the protagonists could overcome the violence       sheuo hui gan considers the series to have a set of  traditional ethical values   she also compares the treatment of alienation in naruto  which naruto overcomes by joining his society  to the portrayal of alienation in akira and neon genesis evangelion  where the main characters remain alienated        naruto has been described by several critics as a coming of age story                 psychologist lawrence c  rubin suggests that the storylines would appeal to readers of any age who have lost loved ones  or are having difficulty finding friends  or who are in other situations shown in the series       in yukari fujimoto s view  as the characters mature  they show respect to the adults who have raised and taught them  making it a conservative storyline in comparison to other manga of the same time period such as one piece and air gear       rik spanjers sees the difference between sasuke  a loner  and naruto  an optimist  as tragic  arguing that the contrast between the two protagonists  approach to the world is fundamental to the plot   naruto s strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect  while sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge        omote tomoyuki points out that there are many comic moments in the story despite the difficulties naruto finds himself in  but the comic elements diminish dramatically over time as naruto grows into a teenager  particularly once part ii begins  sh nen jump began to carry comedies such as gintama and reborn  from      onwards  and in tomoyuki s view this is part of the reason for the change in emphasis  naruto  was not supposed to provide laughter anymore         fujimoto argues that the story has overly traditional gender roles  noting        its representations suggest that men are men and women are women and that they differ naturally regarding aptitude and vocation   for example  the girls initially outperform the boys in the ninja academy  but  once the boys get serious  the girls cannot keep pace   fujimoto points out that this does not upset sakura  who is now surpassed by naruto  character development based on female roles  when it does occur  again uses stereotypical roles  tsunade  for example  a middle aged woman with large breasts  is a clear mother figure  and when she teaches sakura to be a medical ninja  which requires special skills possessed only by women  the story reinforces the idea that women only belong on the battlefield as healers  tsunade herself  who is a figure of authority in naruto  is portrayed as ridiculous in a way that men in the same position are not  fujimoto suggests this presentation of women may explain why the female characters are often the most disliked characters among readers of the manga         naruto run  naruto run the naruto run  or ninja run  is a running style based on the way the characters run leaning forward with their arms behind their backs  it became popular in       in which many students and groups worldwide have had events to run like naruto characters  especially on anniversaries of the series                      on june           matty roberts posted on facebook a satirical event called  storm area     they can t stop all of us  where he wrote  we will all meet up at the area    alien center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry  if we naruto run  we can move faster than their bullets  let s see them  aliens        this quickly became an internet meme  resulting in nationwide alerts and warnings issued by nevada law enforcement and the u s  air force
