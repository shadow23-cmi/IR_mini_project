starting in ancient china  various species of carp  collectively known as asian carp  have been bred and reared as food fish for thousands of years  some of these normally gray or silver species have a tendency to produce red  orange or yellow color mutations  this was first recorded during the jin dynasty  ad                  during the tang dynasty  ad           it was popular to raise carp in ornamental ponds and water gardens  a natural genetic mutation produced gold  actually yellowish orange  rather than silver coloration  people began to breed the gold variety instead of the silver variety  keeping them in ponds or other bodies of water  on special occasions at which guests were expected  they would be moved to a much smaller container for display         by the song dynasty  ad            the selective domestic breeding of goldfish was firmly established     in       the empress of the song dynasty ordered the construction of a pond to collect the red and gold variety  by this time  people outside the imperial family were forbidden to keep goldfish of the gold  yellow  variety  yellow being the imperial color  this is probably the reason why there are more orange goldfish than yellow goldfish  even though the latter are genetically easier to breed     the occurrence of other colors  apart from red and gold  was first recorded in       citation needed   during the ming dynasty              goldfish also began to be raised indoors     which permitted selection for mutations that would not be able to survive in ponds     the first occurrence of fancy tailed goldfish was recorded in the ming dynasty  in       goldfish were introduced to japan     in       goldfish were introduced to portugal and from there to other parts of europe      during the     s  goldfish were highly regarded in southern europe because of their metallic scales  and symbolized good luck and fortune  it became a tradition for married men to give their wives a goldfish on their first anniversary  as a symbol for the prosperous years to come  this tradition quickly died  as goldfish became more available  losing their status  goldfish were first introduced to north america

are respectively sensitive to different colors  red  green  blue and ultraviolet  the ability to distinguish between four different primary colors classifies them as tetrachromats       hearing goldfish have one of the most studied senses of hearing in fish      they have two otoliths  permitting the detection of sound particle motion  and weberian ossicles connecting the swimbladder to the otoliths  facilitating the detection of sound pressure       cognitive abilities goldfish have strong associative learning abilities  as well as social learning skills  in addition  their visual acuity allows them to distinguish between individual humans  owners may notice that fish react favorably to them  swimming to the front of the glass  swimming rapidly around the tank  and going to the surface mouthing for food  while hiding when other people approach the tank  over time  goldfish learn to associate their owners and other humans with food  often  begging  for food whenever their

becomes possible to feed a goldfish by hand without it shying away   goldfish have a memory span of at least three months and can distinguish between different shapes  colors  and sounds          by using positive reinforcement  goldfish can be trained to recognize and to react to light signals of different colors     or to perform tricks      fish respond to certain colors most evidently in relation to feeding  citation needed  fish learn to anticipate feedings provided they occur at around the same time every day   behavior goldfish are gregarious  displaying schooling behavior  as well as displaying the same types of feeding behaviors  goldfish may display similar behaviors when responding to their reflections in a mirror  citation needed   goldfish have learned behaviors  both as groups and as individuals  that stem from native carp behavior  they are a generalist species with varied feeding  breeding  and predator avoidance behaviors that contribute to their success  as fish  they can be described as  friendly  towards each other  very rarely does a goldfish harm another goldfish  nor do the males harm the females during breeding  the only real threat that goldfish present to each other is competing for food  commons  comets  and other faster varieties can easily eat all the food during a feeding before fancy varieties can reach it  this can lead to stunted growth or possible starvation of fancier varieties when they are kept in a pond with their single tailed brethren  as a result  care should be taken to combine only breeds with similar body type and swim

plant matter  like most fish  they are opportunistic feeders and do not stop eating on their own accord  overfeeding can be deleterious to their health  typically by blocking the intestines  this happens most often with selectively bred goldfish  which have a convoluted intestinal tract  when excess food is available  they produce more waste and feces  partly due to incomplete protein digestion  overfeeding can sometimes be diagnosed by observing feces trailing from the fish s cloaca   goldfish specific food has less protein and more carbohydrate than conventional fish food  enthusiasts may supplement this diet with shelled peas  with outer skins removed   blanched green leafy vegetables  and bloodworms  young goldfish benefit from the addition of brine shrimp to their diet  as with all animals  goldfish preferences vary   reproduction goldfish may only grow to sexual maturity with enough water and the right nutrition  most goldfish breed in captivity  particularly in pond settings  breeding usually happens after a significant temperature change  often in spring  males chase gravid female goldfish  females carrying eggs   and prompt them to release their eggs by bumping and nudging them   goldfish  like all cyprinids  are egg layers  their eggs are adhesive and attach to aquatic vegetation  typically dense plants such as cabomba or elodea or a spawning mop  the eggs hatch within    to    hours   within a week or so  the fry begins to assume its final shape  although a year may pass before they develop a mature goldfish color  until then they are a metallic brown like their wild ancestors  in their first weeks of life  the fry grow quickly an adaptation born of the high risk of getting devoured by the adult goldfish  or other fish and insects  in their environment       some highly selectively bred goldfish can no longer breed naturally due to their altered shape  the artificial breeding method called  hand stripping  can assist nature  but can harm the fish if not done correctly  in captivity  adults may also eat young that they encounter   breeding goldfish by the hobbyist is the process of selecting adult fish to reproduce  allowing

cultivation  pool fisheries  a goldfish farm in lonoke  arkansas in aquaria like most species in the carp family  goldfish produce a large amount of waste both in their feces and through their gills

the optimum temperature for goldfish is between     c      f  and     c      f        like all fish  goldfish do not like to be petted  in fact  touching a goldfish can endanger its health  because it can cause the protective slime coat to be damaged or removed  exposing the fish s skin to infection from bacteria or water born parasites  however  goldfish respond to people by surfacing at feeding time  and can be trained or acclimated to taking pellets or flakes from human fingers  the reputation of goldfish dying quickly is often due to poor care      the lifespan of goldfish in captivity can

aquatic plants             harvest stagnation in wild fisheries and overexploitation of popular marine species  combined with a growing demand for high quality protein  encouraged aquaculturists to domesticate other marine species          at the outset of modern aquaculture  many were optimistic that a  blue revolution  could take place in aquaculture  just as the green revolution of the   th century had revolutionized agriculture      although land animals had long been domesticated  most seafood species were still caught from the wild  concerned about the impact of growing demand for seafood on the world s oceans  prominent ocean explorer jacques cousteau wrote in        with earth s burgeoning human populations to feed  we must turn to the sea with new understanding and new

importance of agriculture  to date  only       of known land plant species and         of known land animal species have been domesticated  compared with       of known marine plant species and       of known marine animal species  domestication typically involves about a decade of scientific research      domesticating aquatic species involves fewer risks to humans than do land animals  which took a large toll in human lives  most major human diseases originated in domesticated animals      including diseases such as smallpox and diphtheria  that like most infectious diseases  move to humans from animals  no human pathogens of comparable virulence have yet emerged from marine species  citation needed       biological control methods to manage parasites are already being used  such as cleaner fish  e g  lumpsuckers and wrasse  to control sea lice populations in salmon farming      models are being used to help with spatial planning and siting of fish farms in order to minimize impact       the decline in wild fish stocks has increased the demand for farmed fish      however  finding alternative sources of protein and oil for fish feed is necessary so the aquaculture industry can grow sustainably  otherwise  it represents a great risk for the over exploitation of forage fish       another recent issue following the banning in      of organotins by the international maritime organization is the need to find environmentally friendly  but still effective  compounds with antifouling effects   many new natural compounds are discovered every year  but producing them on a large enough scale for commercial purposes is almost impossible   it is highly probable that future developments in this field will rely on microorganisms  but greater funding and

or ocean enclosures  usually for food  a facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species  natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish hatchery  worldwide  the most important fish species used in fish farming are  in order  carp  salmon  tilapia  and catfish       in the mediterranean  young bluefin tuna are netted at sea and towed slowly towards the shore  they are then interned in offshore pens  sometimes made from floating hdpe pipe      where they are further grown for the market      in       researchers in australia managed for the first time to coax southern bluefin tuna to breed in landlocked tanks  southern bluefin tuna are also caught in the wild and fattened in grow out sea cages in southern spencer gulf  south australia   a similar process is used in the salmon farming section of this industry  juveniles are taken from hatcheries and a variety of methods are used to aid them in their maturation  for example  as stated above  some of the most important fish species in the industry  salmon  can be grown using a cage system  this is done by having netted cages  preferably in open water that has a strong flow  and feeding the salmon a special food mixture that aids their growth  this process allows for year round growth of the fish  thus a higher harvest during the correct seasons          an additional method  known sometimes as sea ranching  has also been used within the industry  sea ranching involves raising fish in a hatchery for a brief time and then releasing them into marine waters for further development  whereupon the fish are recaptured when they have matured       crustaceans see also  shrimp farming  freshwater prawn farming  and astaciculture commercial shrimp farming

traditional  small scale form in southeast asia into a global industry  technological advances have led to ever higher densities per unit area  and broodstock is shipped worldwide  virtually all farmed shrimp are penaeids  i e   shrimp of the family penaeidae   and just two species of shrimp  the pacific white shrimp and the giant tiger prawn  account for about     of all farmed shrimp  these industrial monocultures are very susceptible to disease  which has decimated shrimp populations across entire regions  increasing ecological problems  repeated disease outbreaks  and pressure and criticism from both nongovernmental organizations and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late     s and generally stronger regulations  in       governments  industry

ambient primary production rather than inputs of fish or other feed  as such  shellfish aquaculture is generally perceived as benign or even beneficial       depending on the species and local conditions  bivalve molluscs are either grown on the beach  on longlines  or suspended from rafts and harvested by hand or by dredging  in may      a belgian consortium installed the first of two trial mussel farms on a wind farm in the north sea       abalone farming began in the late     s and early     s in japan and china      since the mid     s  this industry has become increasingly

aquaculture in u s  exclusive economic zone waters  in june       the department of commerce and national oceanic and atmospheric administration released national aquaculture policies     to address this issue and  to meet the growing demand for healthy seafood  to create jobs in coastal communities  and restore vital ecosystems   in       congresswoman lois capps introduced the national

together  however  there are some historical issues with the accuracy of china s returns   in       the fisheries scientists reg watson and daniel pauly expressed concerns in a letter to nature  that china was over reporting its catch from wild fisheries in the     s         they said that made it appear that the global catch since      was increasing annually by         tonnes  whereas it was really shrinking annually by         tonnes  watson and pauly suggested this may be have been related to chinese policies where state entities that monitored the economy were also tasked with increasing output  also  until more recently  the promotion of chinese officials was based on production increases from their own areas           china disputed this claim  the official xinhua news agency quoted yang jian  director general of the agriculture ministry s bureau of fisheries  as saying that china s figures were  basically correct       however  the fao accepted there were issues with the reliability of china s statistical returns  and for a period treated data from china  including the aquaculture data  apart from the rest of the world           aquacultural methods mariculture mariculture mariculture off high island  hong kong  carp are one of the dominant fishes in aquaculture      the adaptable tilapia is another commonly farmed fish main article  mariculture mariculture refers to the cultivation of marine organisms in seawater  usually in sheltered coastal or offshore waters  the farming of marine fish is an example of mariculture  and so also is the farming of marine crustaceans  such as shrimp   mollusks  such as oysters   and seaweed  channel catfish  ictalurus punctatus   hard clams  mercenaria mercenaria  and atlantic salmon  salmo salar  are prominent in the u s  mariculture       mariculture may consist of raising the organisms on or in artificial enclosures such as in floating netted enclosures for salmon and on racks for oysters  in the case of enclosed salmon  they are fed by the operators  oysters on racks filter feed on naturally available food  abalone have been farmed on an artificial reef consuming seaweed which grows naturally on the reef units       integrated main article  integrated multi trophic aquaculture integrated multi trophic aquaculture  imta  is a practice in which the byproducts  wastes  from one species are recycled to become inputs  fertilizers  food  for another  fed aquaculture  for example  fish  shrimp  is combined with inorganic extractive and organic extractive  for example  shellfish  aquaculture to create balanced systems for environmental sustainability  biomitigation   economic stability  product diversification and risk reduction  and social acceptability  better management practices         multi trophic  refers to the incorporation of species from different trophic or nutritional levels in the same system      this is one potential distinction from the age old practice of aquatic polyculture  which could simply be the co culture of different fish species from the same trophic level  in this case  these organisms may all share the same biological and chemical processes  with few synergistic benefits  which could potentially lead to significant shifts in the ecosystem  some traditional polyculture systems may  in fact  incorporate a greater diversity of species  occupying several niches  as extensive cultures  low intensity  low management  within the same         a working imta system can result in greater total production based on mutual benefits to the co cultured species and improved ecosystem health  even if the production of individual species is lower than in a monoculture over a short term period       sometimes the term  integrated aquaculture  is used to describe the integration of monocultures through water transfer      for all intents and purposes  however  the terms  imta  and  integrated aquaculture  differ only in their degree of descriptiveness  aquaponics  fractionated aquaculture  integrated agriculture aquaculture systems  integrated peri urban aquaculture systems  and integrated fisheries aquaculture systems are other variations of the imta concept   netting materials various materials  including nylon  polyester  polypropylene  polyethylene  plastic coated welded wire  rubber  patented rope products  spectra  thorn d  dyneema   galvanized steel and copper are used for netting in aquaculture fish enclosures around the world                         all of these materials are selected for a variety of reasons  including design feasibility  material strength  cost  and corrosion resistance   main article  copper alloys in aquaculture recently  copper alloys have become important netting materials in aquaculture because they are antimicrobial  i e   they destroy bacteria  viruses  fungi  algae  and other microbes  and they therefore prevent biofouling  i e   the undesirable accumulation  adhesion  and growth of microorganisms  plants  algae  tubeworms  barnacles  mollusks  and other organisms   by inhibiting microbial growth  copper alloy aquaculture cages avoid costly net changes that are necessary with other materials  the resistance of organism growth on copper alloy nets also provides a cleaner and healthier environment for farmed fish to grow and thrive   issues see also  issues with salmon aquaculture if performed without consideration for potential local environmental impacts  aquaculture in inland waters can result in more environmental damage than wild fisheries  though with less waste produced per kg on a global scale       local concerns with aquaculture in inland waters may include waste handling  side effects of antibiotics  competition between farmed and wild animals  and the potential introduction of invasive plant and animal species  or foreign pathogens  particularly if unprocessed fish are used to feed more marketable carnivorous fish  if non local live feeds are used  aquaculture may introduce exotic plants or animals with disastrous effects  improvements in methods resulting from advances in research and the availability of commercial feeds has reduced some of these concerns since their greater prevalence in the     s and     s              fish waste is organic and composed of nutrients necessary in all components of aquatic food webs  in ocean aquaculture often produces much higher than normal fish waste concentrations  the waste collects on the ocean bottom  damaging or eliminating bottom dwelling life       waste can also decrease dissolved oxygen levels in the water column  putting further pressure on wild animals       an alternative model to food being added to the ecosystem  is the installation of artificial reef structures to increase the habitat niches available  without the need to add any more than ambient feed and nutrient  this has been used in the  ranching  of abalone in western australia       impacts on wild fish some carnivorous and omnivorous farmed fish species are fed wild forage fish  although carnivorous farmed fish represented only    percent of aquaculture production by weight in       they represented    percent of aquaculture production by value        farming of carnivorous species like salmon and shrimp leads to a high demand for forage fish to match the nutrition they get in the wild  fish do not actually produce omega   fatty acids  but instead accumulate them from either consuming microalgae that produce these fatty acids  as is the case with forage fish like herring and sardines  or  as is the case with fatty predatory fish  like salmon  by eating prey fish that have accumulated omega   fatty acids from microalgae  to satisfy this requirement  more than    percent of the world fish oil production is fed to farmed salmon        farmed salmon consume more wild fish than they generate as a final product  although the efficiency of production is improving  to produce one pound of farmed salmon  products from several pounds of wild fish are fed to them   this can be described as the  fish in fish out   fifo  ratio  in       salmon had a fifo ratio of      meaning     pounds of wild fish feed were required to produce   pound of salmon   by      the ratio had fallen to           additionally  a growing share of fish oil and fishmeal come from residues  byproducts of fish processing   rather than dedicated whole fish       in          percent of fish oil and    percent of fishmeal came from residues       however  fishmeal and oil from residues instead of whole fish have a different composition with more ash and less protein  which may limit its potential use for aquaculture   as the salmon farming industry expands  it requires more wild forage fish for feed  at a time when seventy five percent of the world s monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield     the industrial scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming then impacts the survivability of the wild predator fish who rely on them for food  an important step in reducing the impact of aquaculture on wild fish is shifting carnivorous species to plant based feeds  salmon feeds  for example  have gone from containing only fishmeal and oil to containing    percent plant protein       the usda has also experimented with using grain based feeds for farmed trout       when properly formulated  and often mixed with fishmeal or oil   plant based feeds can provide proper nutrition and similar growth rates in carnivorous farmed fish        another impact aquaculture production can have on wild fish is the risk of fish escaping from coastal pens  where they can interbreed with their wild counterparts  diluting wild genetic stocks       escaped fish can become invasive  out competing native species                  coastal ecosystems aquaculture is becoming a significant threat to coastal ecosystems  about    percent of mangrove forests have been destroyed since       partly due to shrimp farming       an extended cost benefit analysis of the total economic value of shrimp aquaculture built on mangrove ecosystems found that the external costs were much higher than the external benefits       over four decades          hectares          acres  of indonesian mangroves have been converted to shrimp farms  most of these farms are abandoned within a decade because of the toxin build up and nutrient loss             pollution from sea cage aquaculture  salmon aquaculture  norway salmon farms are typically sited in pristine coastal ecosystems which they then pollute  a farm with         salmon discharges more fecal waste than a city of        people  this waste is discharged directly into the surrounding aquatic environment  untreated  often containing antibiotics and pesticides      there is also an accumulation of heavy metals on the benthos  seafloor  near the salmon farms  particularly copper and zinc        in       mass fish kill events impacted salmon farmers along chile s coast and the wider ecology       increases in aquaculture production and its associated effluent were considered to be possible contributing factors to fish and molluscan mortality        sea cage aquaculture is responsible for nutrient enrichment of the waters in which they are established  this results from fish wastes and uneaten feed inputs  elements of most concern are nitrogen and phosphorus which can promote algal growth  including harmful algal blooms which can be toxic to fish  flushing times  current speeds  distance from the shore and water depth are important considerations when locating sea cages in order to minimize the impacts of nutrient enrichment on coastal ecosystems   the extent of the effects of pollution from sea cage aquaculture varies depending on where the cages are located  which species are kept  how densely cages are stocked and what the fish are fed  important species specific variables include the species  food conversion ratio  fcr  and nitrogen retention  studies prior to      determined that the amount of nitrogen introduced as feed which is lost to the water column and seafloor as waste varies from    to      citation needed   freshwater ecosystems whole lake experiments carried out at the experimental lakes area in ontario  canada have displayed the potential for cage aquaculture to source numerous changes in freshwater ecosystems  following the initiation of an experimental rainbow trout cage farm in a small boreal lake  dramatic reductions in mysis concentrations associated with a decrease in dissolved oxygen were observed       significant increases in ammonium and total phosphorus  a driver for eutrophication in freshwater systems       were measured in the hypolimnion of the lake  annual phosphorus inputs from aquaculture waste exceeded that of natural inputs from atmospheric deposition and inflows       and phytoplankton biomass has had a four fold annual increase following the initiation of the experimental farm        genetic modification a type of salmon called the aquadvantage salmon has been genetically modified for faster growth  although it has not been approved for commercial use  due to controversy       the altered salmon incorporates a growth hormone from a chinook salmon that allows it to reach full size in       months  instead of the normal    months for atlantic salmon  and while consuming    percent less feed       the u s  food and drug administration reviewed the aquadvantage salmon in a draft environmental assessment and determined that it  would not have a significant impact  fonsi  on the u s  environment         ecological benefits while some forms of aquaculture can be devastating to ecosystems  such as shrimp farming in mangroves  other forms can be very beneficial  shellfish aquaculture adds substantial filter feeding capacity to an environment which can significantly improve water quality  a single oyster can filter    gallons of water a day  removing microscopic algal cells  by removing these cells  shellfish are removing nitrogen and other nutrients from the system and either retaining it or releasing it as waste which sinks to the bottom  by harvesting these shellfish the nitrogen they retained is completely removed from the system       raising and harvesting kelp and other macroalgae directly remove nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus  repackaging these nutrients can relieve eutrophic  or nutrient rich  conditions known for their low dissolved oxygen which can decimate species diversity and abundance of marine life  removing algal cells from the water also increases light penetration  allowing plants such as eelgrass to reestablish themselves and further increase oxygen levels  citation needed         aquaculture in an area can provide for crucial ecological functions for the inhabitants  shellfish beds or cages can provide habitat structure  this structure can be used as shelter by invertebrates  small fish or crustaceans to potentially increase their abundance and maintain biodiversity  increased shelter raises stocks of prey fish and small crustaceans by increasing recruitment opportunities in turn providing more prey for higher trophic levels  one study estimated that    square meters of oyster reef could enhance an ecosystem s biomass by      kg      the shellfish acting as herbivores will also be preyed on  this moves energy directly from primary producers to higher trophic levels potentially skipping out on multiple energetically costly trophic jumps which would increase biomass in the ecosystem  citation needed   seaweed farming is a carbon negative crop  with a high potential for climate change mitigation        the ipcc special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate recommends  further research attention  as a mitigation tactic        animal welfare see also  pain in fish and pain in invertebrates as with the farming of terrestrial animals  social attitudes influence the need for humane practices and regulations in farmed marine animals  under the guidelines advised by the farm animal welfare council good animal welfare means both fitness and a sense of well being in the animal s physical and mental state  this can be defined by the five freedoms   freedom from hunger   thirst freedom from discomfort freedom from pain  disease  or injury freedom to express normal behaviour freedom from fear and distress however  the controversial issue in aquaculture is whether fish and farmed marine invertebrates are actually sentient  or have the perception and awareness to experience suffering  although no evidence of this has been found in marine invertebrates       recent studies conclude that fish do have the necessary receptors  nociceptors  to sense noxious stimuli and so are likely to experience states of pain  fear and stress            consequently  welfare in aquaculture is directed at vertebrates  finfish in particular        common welfare concerns welfare in aquaculture can be impacted by a number of issues such as stocking densities  behavioural interactions  disease and parasitism  a major problem in determining the cause of impaired welfare is that these issues are often all interrelated and influence each other at different times        optimal stocking density is often defined by the carrying capacity of the stocked environment and the amount of individual space needed by the fish  which is very species specific  although behavioural interactions such as shoaling may mean that high stocking densities are beneficial to some species            in many cultured species high stocking densities may be of concern  crowding can constrain normal swimming behaviour  as well as increase aggressive and competitive behaviours such as cannibalism       feed competition       territoriality and dominance subordination hierarchies       this potentially increases the risk of tissue damage due to abrasion from fish to fish contact or fish to cage contact       fish can suffer reductions in food intake and food conversion efficiency       in addition  high stocking densities can result in water flow being insufficient  creating inadequate oxygen supply and waste product removal       dissolved oxygen is essential for fish respiration and concentrations below critical levels can induce stress and even lead to asphyxiation       ammonia  a nitrogen excretion product  is highly toxic to fish at accumulated levels  particularly when oxygen concentrations are low        many of these interactions and effects cause stress in the fish  which can be a major factor in facilitating fish disease       for many parasites  infestation depends on the host s degree of mobility  the density of the host population and vulnerability of the host s defence system       sea lice are the primary parasitic problem for finfish in aquaculture  high numbers causing widespread skin erosion and haemorrhaging  gill congestion  and increased mucus production       there are also a number of prominent viral and bacterial pathogens that can have severe effects on internal organs and nervous systems        improving welfare the key to improving welfare of marine cultured organisms is to reduce stress to a minimum  as prolonged or repeated stress can cause a range of adverse effects  attempts to minimise stress can occur throughout the culture process  during grow out it is important to keep stocking densities at appropriate levels specific to each species  as well as separating size classes and grading to reduce aggressive behavioural interactions  keeping nets and cages clean can assist positive water flow to reduce the risk of water degradation   not surprisingly disease and parasitism can have a major effect on fish welfare and it is important for farmers not only to manage infected stock but also to apply disease prevention measures  however  prevention methods  such as vaccination  can also induce stress because of the extra handling and injection       other methods include adding antibiotics to feed  adding chemicals into water for treatment baths and biological control  such as using cleaner wrasse to remove lice from farmed salmon        many steps are involved in transport  including capture  food deprivation to reduce faecal contamination of transport water  transfer to transport vehicle via nets or pumps  plus transport and transfer to the delivery location  during transport water needs to be maintained to a high quality  with regulated temperature  sufficient oxygen and minimal waste products            in some cases anaesthetics may be used in small doses to calm fish before transport        aquaculture is sometimes part of an environmental rehabilitation program or as an aid in conserving endangered species        prospects global wild fisheries are in decline  with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition       the aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish  like salmon  does not help the problem because they need to eat products from other fish  such as fish meal and fish oil  studies have shown that salmon farming has major negative impacts on wild salmon  as well as the forage fish that need to be caught to feed them            fish that are higher on the food chain are less efficient sources of food energy   apart from fish and shrimp  some aquaculture undertakings  such as seaweed and filter feeding bivalve mollusks like oysters  clams  mussels and scallops  are relatively benign and even environmentally restorative      filter feeders filter pollutants as well as nutrients from the water  improving water quality       seaweeds extract nutrients such as inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus directly from the water      and filter feeding mollusks can extract nutrients as they feed on particulates  such as phytoplankton and detritus        some profitable aquaculture cooperatives promote sustainable practices       new methods lessen the risk of biological and chemical pollution through minimizing fish stress  fallowing netpens  and applying integrated pest management  vaccines are being used more and more to reduce antibiotic use for disease control        onshore recirculating aquaculture systems  facilities using polyculture techniques  and properly sited facilities  for example  offshore areas with strong currents  are examples of ways to manage negative environmental effects   recirculating aquaculture systems  ras  recycle water by circulating it through filters to remove fish waste and food and then recirculating it back into the tanks  this saves water and the waste gathered can be used in compost or  in some cases  could even be treated and used on land  while ras was developed with freshwater fish in mind  scientists associated with the agricultural research service have found a way to rear saltwater fish using ras in low salinity waters       although saltwater fish are raised in off shore cages or caught with nets in water that typically has a salinity of    parts per thousand  ppt   scientists were able to produce healthy pompano  a saltwater fish  in tanks with a salinity of only   ppt  commercializing low salinity ras are predicted to have positive environmental and economical effects  unwanted nutrients from the fish food would not be added to the ocean and the risk of transmitting diseases between wild and farm raised fish would greatly be reduced  the price of expensive saltwater fish  such as the pompano and combia used in the experiments  would be reduced  however  before any of this can be done researchers must study every aspect of the fish s lifecycle  including the amount of ammonia and nitrate the fish will tolerate in the water  what to feed the fish during each stage of its lifecycle  the stocking rate that will produce the healthiest fish  etc        some    countries now use geothermal energy for aquaculture  including china  israel  and the united states       in california  for example     fish farms produce tilapia  bass  and catfish with warm water from underground  this warmer water enables fish to grow all year round and mature more quickly  collectively these california farms produce     million kilograms of fish each year        see also icon water portal  marine life portal agroecology alligator farm aquaponics blue revolution copper alloys in aquaculture maggots

manipulation  is the direct manipulation of an organism s genes using biotechnology  it is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells  including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel organisms  new dna is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using recombinant dna methods or by artificially synthesising the dna  a construct is usually created and used to insert this dna into the host organism  the first recombinant dna molecule was made by paul berg in      by combining dna from the monkey virus sv   with the lambda virus  as well as inserting genes  the process can be used to remove  or  knock out   genes  the new dna can be inserted randomly  or targeted to a specific part of the genome   an organism that is generated through genetic engineering is considered to be genetically modified  gm  and the resulting entity is a genetically modified organism  gmo   the first gmo was a bacterium generated by herbert boyer and stanley cohen in       rudolf jaenisch created the first gm animal when he inserted foreign dna into a mouse in       the first company to focus on genetic engineering  genentech  was founded in      and started the production of human proteins  genetically engineered human insulin was produced in      and insulin producing bacteria were commercialised in       genetically modified food has been sold since       with the release of the flavr savr tomato  the flavr savr was engineered to have a longer shelf life  but most current gm crops are modified to increase resistance to insects and herbicides  glofish  the first gmo designed as a pet  was sold in the united states in december       in      salmon modified with a growth hormone were sold   genetic engineering has been applied in numerous fields including research  medicine  industrial biotechnology and agriculture  in research gmos are used to study gene function and expression through loss of function  gain of function  tracking and expression experiments  by knocking out genes responsible for certain conditions it is possible to create animal model organisms of human diseases  as well as producing hormones  vaccines and other drugs  genetic engineering has the potential to cure genetic diseases through gene therapy  the same techniques that are used to produce drugs can also have industrial applications such as producing enzymes for laundry detergent  cheeses and other products   the rise of commercialised genetically modified crops has provided economic benefit to farmers in many different countries  but has also been the source of most of the controversy surrounding the technology  this has been present since its early use  the first field trials were destroyed by anti gm activists  although there is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from gm crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food  gm food safety is a leading concern with critics  gene flow  impact on non target organisms  control of the food supply and intellectual property rights have also been raised as potential issues  these concerns have led to the development of a regulatory framework  which started in       it has led to an international treaty  the cartagena protocol on biosafety  that was adopted in       individual countries have developed their own regulatory systems regarding gmos  with the most marked differences occurring between the us and europe   iupac definition genetic engineering  process of

controversy   in popular culture   see also   references    further reading    external links overview  comparison of conventional plant breeding with transgenic and cisgenic genetic modification genetic engineering is a process that alters the genetic structure of an organism by either removing or introducing dna  unlike traditional animal and plant breeding  which involves doing multiple crosses and then selecting for the organism with the desired phenotype  genetic engineering takes the gene directly from one organism and delivers it to the other  this is much faster  can be used to insert any genes from any organism  even ones from different domains  and prevents other undesirable genes from also being added      genetic engineering could potentially fix severe genetic disorders in humans by replacing the defective gene with a functioning one     it is an important tool in research that allows the function of specific genes to be studied     drugs  vaccines and other products have been harvested from organisms engineered to produce them     crops have been developed that aid food security by increasing yield  nutritional value and tolerance to environmental stresses      the dna can be introduced directly into the host organism or into a cell that is then fused or hybridised with the host     this relies on recombinant nucleic acid techniques to form new combinations of heritable genetic material followed by the incorporation of that material either indirectly through a vector system or directly through micro injection  macro injection or micro encapsulation      genetic engineering does not normally include traditional breeding  in vitro fertilisation  induction of polyploidy  mutagenesis and cell fusion techniques that do not use recombinant nucleic acids or a genetically modified organism in the process     however  some broad definitions of genetic engineering include selective breeding     cloning and stem cell research  although not considered genetic engineering      are closely related and genetic engineering can be used within them      synthetic biology is an emerging discipline that takes genetic engineering a step further by introducing artificially synthesised material into an organism      such synthetic dna as artificially expanded genetic information system and hachimoji dna is made in this new field   plants  animals or microorganisms that have been changed through genetic engineering are termed genetically modified organisms or gmos      if genetic material from another species is added to the host  the resulting organism is called transgenic  if genetic material from the same species or a species that can naturally breed with the host is used the resulting organism is called cisgenic      if genetic engineering is used to remove genetic material from the target organism the resulting organism is termed a knockout organism      in europe genetic modification is synonymous with genetic engineering while within the united states of america and canada genetic modification can also be used to refer to more conventional breeding methods               history main article  history of genetic engineering humans have altered the genomes of species for thousands of years through selective breeding  or artificial selection             as contrasted with natural selection  more recently  mutation breeding has used exposure to chemicals or radiation to produce a high frequency of random mutations  for selective breeding purposes  genetic engineering as the direct manipulation of dna by humans outside breeding and mutations has only existed since the     s  the term  genetic engineering  was first coined by jack williamson in his science fiction novel dragon s island  published in            one year before dna s role in heredity was confirmed by alfred hershey and martha chase      and two years before james watson and francis crick showed that the dna molecule has a double helix structure   though the general concept of direct genetic manipulation was explored in rudimentary form in stanley g  weinbaum s      science fiction story proteus island            in      rudolf jaenisch created a genetically modified mouse  the first gm animal  in       paul berg created the first recombinant dna molecules by combining dna from the monkey virus sv   with that of the lambda virus      in      herbert boyer and stanley cohen created the first transgenic organism by inserting antibiotic resistance genes into the plasmid of an escherichia coli bacterium          a year later rudolf jaenisch created a transgenic mouse by introducing foreign dna into its embryo  making it the world s first transgenic animal     these achievements led to concerns in the scientific community about potential risks from genetic engineering  which were first discussed in depth at the asilomar conference in       one of the main recommendations from this meeting was that government oversight of recombinant dna research should be established until the technology was deemed safe           in      genentech  the first genetic engineering company  was founded by herbert boyer and robert swanson and a year later the company produced a human protein  somatostatin  in e coli  genentech announced the production of genetically engineered human insulin in           in       the u s  supreme court in the diamond v  chakrabarty case ruled that genetically altered life could be patented      the insulin produced by bacteria was approved for release by the food and drug administration  fda  in            in       a biotech company  advanced genetic sciences  ags  applied for u s  government authorisation to perform field tests with the ice minus strain of pseudomonas syringae to protect crops from frost  but environmental groups and protestors delayed the field tests for four years with legal challenges      in       the ice minus strain of p  syringae became the first genetically modified organism  gmo  to be released into the environment     when a strawberry field and a potato field in california were sprayed with it      both test fields were attacked by activist groups the night before the tests occurred   the world s first trial site attracted the world s first field trasher        the first field trials of genetically engineered plants occurred in france and the us in       tobacco plants were engineered to be resistant to herbicides      the people s republic of china was the first country to commercialise transgenic plants  introducing a virus resistant tobacco in           in      calgene attained approval to commercially release the first genetically modified food  the flavr savr  a tomato engineered to have a longer shelf life      in       the european union approved tobacco engineered to be resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil  making it the first genetically engineered crop commercialised in europe      in       bt potato was approved safe by the environmental protection agency  after having been approved by the fda  making it the first pesticide producing crop to be approved in the us      in         transgenic crops were grown commercially in    countries  the largest of which by area grown were the us  brazil  argentina  india  canada  china  paraguay and south africa       in       scientists at the j  craig venter institute created the first synthetic genome and inserted it into an empty bacterial cell  the resulting bacterium  named mycoplasma laboratorium  could replicate and produce proteins          four years later this was taken a step further when a bacterium was developed that replicated a plasmid containing a unique base pair  creating the first organism engineered to use an expanded genetic alphabet          in       jennifer doudna and emmanuelle charpentier collaborated to develop the crispr cas  system          a technique which can be used to easily and specifically alter the genome of almost any organism       process main article  genetic engineering techniques  polymerase chain reaction is a powerful tool used in molecular cloning creating a gmo is a multi step process  genetic engineers must first choose what gene they wish to insert into the organism  this is driven by what the aim is for the resultant organism and is built on earlier research  genetic screens can be carried out to determine potential genes and further tests then used to identify the best candidates  the development of microarrays  transcriptomics and genome sequencing has made it much easier to find suitable genes      luck also plays its part  the round up ready gene was discovered after scientists noticed a bacterium thriving in the presence of the herbicide       gene isolation and cloning main article  molecular cloning the next step is to isolate the candidate gene  the cell containing the gene is opened and the dna is purified      the gene is separated by using restriction enzymes to cut the dna into fragments     or polymerase chain reaction  pcr  to amplify up the gene segment      these segments can then be extracted through gel electrophoresis  if the chosen gene or the donor organism s genome has been well studied it may already be accessible from a genetic library  if the dna sequence is known  but no copies of the gene are available  it can also be artificially synthesised      once isolated the gene is ligated into a plasmid that is then inserted into a bacterium  the plasmid is replicated when the bacteria divide  ensuring unlimited copies of the gene are available       before the gene is inserted into the target organism it must be combined with other genetic elements  these include a promoter and terminator region  which initiate and end transcription  a selectable marker gene is added  which in most cases confers antibiotic resistance  so researchers can easily determine which cells have been successfully transformed  the gene can also be modified at this stage for better expression or effectiveness  these manipulations are carried out using recombinant dna techniques  such as restriction digests  ligations and molecular cloning       inserting dna into the host genome main article  gene delivery  a gene gun uses biolistics to insert dna into plant tissue there are a number of techniques used to insert genetic material into the host genome  some bacteria can naturally take up foreign dna  this ability can be induced in other bacteria via stress  e g  thermal or electric shock   which increases the cell membrane s permeability to dna  up taken dna can either integrate with the genome or exist as extrachromosomal dna  dna is generally inserted into animal cells using microinjection  where it can be injected through the cell s nuclear envelope directly into the nucleus  or through the use of viral vectors       plant genomes can be engineered by physical methods or by use of agrobacterium for the delivery of sequences hosted in t dna binary vectors  in plants the dna is often inserted using agrobacterium mediated transformation      taking advantage of the agrobacteriums t dna sequence that allows natural insertion of genetic material into plant cells      other methods include biolistics  where particles of gold or tungsten are coated with dna and then shot into young plant cells      and electroporation  which involves using an electric shock to make the cell membrane permeable to plasmid dna   as only a single cell is transformed with genetic material  the organism must be regenerated from that single cell  in plants this is accomplished through the use of tissue culture          in animals it is necessary to ensure that the inserted dna is present in the embryonic stem cells      bacteria consist of a single cell and reproduce clonally so regeneration is not necessary  selectable markers are used to easily differentiate transformed from untransformed cells  these markers are usually present in the transgenic organism  although a number of strategies have been developed that can remove the selectable marker from the mature transgenic plant        a  tumefaciens attaching itself to a carrot cell further testing using pcr  southern hybridization  and dna sequencing is conducted to confirm that an organism contains the new gene      these tests can also confirm the chromosomal location and copy number of the inserted gene  the presence of the gene does not guarantee it will be expressed at appropriate levels in the target tissue so methods that look for and measure the gene products  rna and protein  are also used  these include northern hybridisation  quantitative rt pcr  western blot  immunofluorescence  elisa and phenotypic analysis       the new genetic material can be inserted randomly within the host genome or targeted to a specific location  the technique of gene targeting uses homologous recombination to make desired changes to a specific endogenous gene  this tends to occur at a relatively low frequency in plants and animals and generally requires the use of selectable markers  the frequency of gene targeting can be greatly enhanced through genome editing  genome editing uses artificially engineered nucleases that create specific double stranded breaks at desired locations in the genome  and use the cell s endogenous mechanisms to repair the induced break by the natural processes of homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining  there are four families of engineered nucleases  meganucleases          zinc finger nucleases          transcription activator like effector nucleases  talens           and the cas  guiderna system  adapted from crispr           talen and crispr are the two most commonly used and each has its own advantages      talens have greater target specificity  while crispr is easier to design and more efficient      in addition to enhancing gene targeting  engineered nucleases can be used to introduce mutations at endogenous genes that generate a gene knockout           applications genetic engineering has applications in medicine  research  industry and agriculture and can be used on a wide range of plants  animals and microorganisms  bacteria  the first organisms to be genetically modified  can have plasmid dna inserted containing new genes that code for medicines or enzymes that process food and other substrates          plants have been modified for insect protection  herbicide resistance  virus resistance  enhanced nutrition  tolerance to environmental pressures and the production of edible vaccines      most commercialised gmos are insect resistant or herbicide tolerant crop plants      genetically modified animals have been used for research  model animals and the production of agricultural or pharmaceutical products  the genetically modified animals include animals with genes knocked out  increased susceptibility to disease  hormones for extra growth and the ability to express proteins in their milk       medicine genetic engineering has many applications to medicine that include the manufacturing of drugs  creation of model animals that mimic human conditions and gene therapy  one of the earliest uses of genetic engineering was to mass produce human insulin in bacteria      this application has now been applied to  human growth hormones  follicle stimulating hormones  for treating infertility   human albumin  monoclonal antibodies  antihemophilic factors  vaccines and many other drugs          mouse hybridomas  cells fused together to create monoclonal antibodies  have been adapted through genetic engineering to create human monoclonal antibodies      in       genetic engineering of chimeric antigen receptors on a patient s own t cells was approved by the u s  fda as a treatment for the cancer acute lymphoblastic leukemia  genetically engineered viruses are being developed that can still confer immunity  but lack the infectious sequences       genetic engineering is also used to create animal models of human diseases  genetically modified mice are the most common genetically engineered animal model      they have been used to study and model cancer  the oncomouse   obesity  heart disease  diabetes  arthritis  substance abuse  anxiety  aging and parkinson disease      potential cures can be tested against these mouse models  also genetically modified pigs have been bred with the aim of increasing the success of pig to human organ transplantation       gene therapy is the genetic engineering of humans  generally by replacing defective genes with effective ones  clinical research using somatic gene therapy has been conducted with several diseases  including x linked scid      chronic lymphocytic leukemia  cll           and parkinson s disease      in       alipogene tiparvovec became the first gene therapy treatment to be approved for clinical use          in      a virus was used to insert a healthy gene into the skin cells of a boy suffering from a rare skin disease  epidermolysis bullosa  in order to grow  and then graft healthy skin onto    percent of the boy s body which was affected by the illness       germline gene therapy would result in any change being inheritable  which has raised concerns within the scientific community          in       crispr was used to edit the dna of non viable human embryos            leading scientists of major world academies to call for a moratorium on inheritable human genome edits       there are also concerns that the technology could be used not just for treatment  but for enhancement  modification or alteration of a human beings  appearance  adaptability  intelligence  character or behavior       the distinction between cure and enhancement can also be difficult to establish       in november       he jiankui announced that he had edited the genomes of two human embryos  to attempt to disable the ccr  gene  which codes for a receptor that hiv uses to enter cells  he said that twin girls  lulu and nana  had been born a few weeks earlier  he said that the girls still carried functional copies of ccr  along with disabled ccr   mosaicism  and were still vulnerable to hiv  the work was widely condemned as unethical  dangerous  and premature       currently  germline modification is banned in    countries  scientists that do this type of research will often let embryos grow for a few days without allowing it to develop into a baby         researchers are altering the genome of pigs to induce the growth of human organs to be used in transplants  scientists are creating  gene drives   changing the genomes of mosquitoes to make them immune to malaria  and then looking to spread the genetically altered mosquitoes throughout the mosquito population in the hopes of eliminating the disease        research  knockout mice  human cells in which some proteins are fused with green fluorescent protein to allow them to be visualised genetic engineering is an important tool for natural scientists  with the creation of transgenic organisms one of the most important tools for analysis of gene function       genes and other genetic information from a wide range of organisms can be inserted into bacteria for storage and modification  creating genetically modified bacteria in the process  bacteria are cheap  easy to grow  clonal  multiply quickly  relatively easy to transform and can be stored at      c almost indefinitely  once a gene is isolated it can be stored inside the bacteria providing an unlimited supply for research       organisms are genetically engineered to discover the functions of certain genes  this could be the effect on the phenotype of the organism  where the gene is expressed or what other genes it interacts with  these experiments generally involve loss of function  gain of function  tracking and expression   loss of function experiments  such as in a gene knockout experiment  in which an organism is engineered to lack the activity of one or more genes  in a simple knockout a copy of the desired gene has been altered to make it non functional  embryonic stem cells incorporate the altered gene  which replaces the already present functional copy  these stem cells are injected into blastocysts  which are implanted into surrogate mothers  this allows the experimenter to analyse the defects caused by this mutation and thereby determine the role of particular genes  it is used especially frequently in developmental biology       when this is done by creating a library of genes with point mutations at every position in the area of interest  or even every position in the whole gene  this is called  scanning mutagenesis   the simplest method  and the first to be used  is  alanine scanning   where every position in turn is mutated to the unreactive amino acid alanine       gain of function experiments  the logical counterpart of knockouts  these are sometimes performed in conjunction with knockout experiments to more finely establish the function of the desired gene  the process is much the same as that in knockout engineering  except that the construct is designed to increase the function of the gene  usually by providing extra copies of the gene or inducing synthesis of the protein more frequently  gain of function is used to tell whether or not a protein is sufficient for a function  but does not always mean it s required  especially when dealing with genetic or functional redundancy       tracking experiments  which seek to gain information about the localisation and interaction of the desired protein  one way to do this is to replace the wild type gene with a  fusion  gene  which is a juxtaposition of the wild type gene with a reporting element such as green fluorescent protein  gfp  that will allow easy visualisation of the products of the genetic modification  while this is a useful technique  the manipulation can destroy the function of the gene  creating secondary effects and possibly calling into question the results of the experiment  more sophisticated techniques are now in development that can track protein products without mitigating their function  such as the addition of small sequences that will serve as binding motifs to monoclonal antibodies       expression studies aim to discover where and when specific proteins are produced  in these experiments  the dna sequence before the dna that codes for a protein  known as a gene s promoter  is reintroduced into an organism with the protein coding region replaced by a reporter gene such as gfp or an enzyme that catalyses the production of a dye  thus the time and place where a particular protein is produced can be observed  expression studies can be taken a step further by altering the promoter to find which pieces are crucial for the proper expression of the gene and are actually bound by transcription factor proteins  this process is known as promoter bashing       industrial main article  industrial microbiology  products of genetic engineering organisms can have their cells transformed with a gene coding for a useful protein  such as an enzyme  so that they will overexpress the desired protein  mass quantities of the protein can then be manufactured by growing the transformed organism in bioreactor equipment using industrial fermentation  and then purifying the protein       some genes do not work well in bacteria  so yeast  insect cells or mammalians cells can also be used       these techniques are used to produce medicines such as insulin  human growth hormone  and vaccines  supplements such as tryptophan  aid in the production of food  chymosin in cheese making  and fuels       other applications with genetically engineered bacteria could involve making them perform tasks outside their natural cycle  such as making biofuels       cleaning up oil spills  carbon and other toxic waste      and detecting arsenic in drinking water       certain genetically modified microbes can also be used in biomining and bioremediation  due to their ability to extract heavy metals from their environment and incorporate them into compounds that are more easily recoverable        in materials science  a genetically modified virus has been used in a research laboratory as a scaffold for assembling a more environmentally friendly lithium ion battery            bacteria have also been engineered to function as sensors by expressing a fluorescent protein under certain environmental conditions        agriculture main articles  genetically modified crops and genetically modified food  bt toxins present in peanut leaves  bottom image  protect it from extensive damage caused by lesser cornstalk borer larvae  top image        one of the best known and controversial applications of genetic engineering is the creation and use of genetically modified crops or genetically modified livestock to produce genetically modified food  crops have been developed to increase production  increase tolerance to abiotic stresses  alter the composition of the food  or to produce novel products        the first crops to be released commercially on a large scale provided protection from insect pests or tolerance to herbicides  fungal and virus resistant crops have also been developed or are in development            this makes the insect and weed management of crops easier and can indirectly increase crop yield            gm crops that directly improve yield by accelerating growth or making the plant more hardy  by improving salt  cold or drought tolerance  are also under development       in      salmon have been genetically modified with growth hormones to reach normal adult size much faster        gmos have been developed that modify the quality of produce by increasing the nutritional value or providing more industrially useful qualities or quantities       the amflora potato produces a more industrially useful blend of starches  soybeans and canola have been genetically modified to produce more healthy oils            the first commercialised gm food was a tomato that had delayed

conservation and natural area management  gene transfer through viral vectors has been proposed as a means of controlling invasive species as well as vaccinating threatened fauna from disease       transgenic trees have been suggested as a way to confer resistance to pathogens in wild populations       with the increasing risks of maladaptation in organisms as a result of climate change and other perturbations  facilitated adaptation through gene tweaking could be one solution to reducing extinction risks       applications of genetic engineering in conservation are thus far mostly theoretical and have yet to be put into practice   genetic engineering is also being used to create microbial art       some bacteria have been genetically engineered to create black and white photographs       novelty items such as lavender colored carnations       blue roses       and glowing fish           have also been produced through genetic engineering   regulation main article  regulation of genetic engineering the regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the development and release of gmos  the development of a regulatory framework began in       at asilomar  california       the asilomar meeting recommended a set of voluntary guidelines regarding the use of recombinant technology      as the technology improved the us established a committee at the office of science and technology       which assigned regulatory approval of gm food to the usda  fda and epa       the cartagena protocol on biosafety  an international treaty that governs the transfer  handling  and use of gmos       was adopted on    january            one hundred and fifty seven countries are members of the protocol and many use it as a reference point for their own regulations        the legal and regulatory status of gm foods varies by country  with some nations banning or restricting them  and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation                      some countries allow the import of gm food with authorisation  but either do not allow its cultivation  russia  norway  israel  or have provisions for cultivation even though no gm products are yet produced  japan  south korea   most countries that do not allow gmo cultivation do permit research       some of the most marked differences occurring between the us and europe  the us policy focuses on the product  not the process   only looks at verifiable scientific risks and uses the concept of substantial equivalence       the european union by contrast has possibly the most stringent gmo regulations in the world       all gmos  along with irradiated food  are considered  new food  and subject to extensive  case by case  science based food evaluation by the european food safety authority  the criteria for authorisation fall in four broad categories   safety    freedom of choice    labelling   and  traceability        the level of regulation in other countries that cultivate gmos lie in between europe and the united states   regulatory agencies by geographical region region regulators notes

 the individual state governments can then assess the impact of release on markets and trade and apply further legislation to control approved genetically modified products       one of the key issues concerning regulators is whether gm products should be labeled  the european commission says that mandatory labeling and traceability are needed to allow for informed choice  avoid potential false advertising      and facilitate the withdrawal of products if adverse effects on health or the environment are discovered       the american medical association      and the american association for the advancement of science      say that absent scientific evidence of harm even voluntary labeling is misleading and will falsely alarm consumers  labeling of gmo products in the marketplace is required in    countries       labeling can be mandatory up to a threshold gm content level  which varies between countries  or voluntary  in canada and the us labeling of gm food is voluntary       while in europe all food  including processed food  or feed which contains greater than      of approved gmos must be labelled        controversy main article  genetically modified food controversies critics have objected to the use of genetic engineering on several grounds  including ethical  ecological and economic concerns  many of these concerns involve gm crops and whether food produced from them is safe and what impact growing them will have on the environment  these controversies have led to litigation  international trade disputes  and protests  and to restrictive regulation of commercial products in some countries        accusations that scientists are  playing god  and other religious issues have been ascribed to the technology from the beginning       other ethical issues raised include the patenting of life       the use of intellectual property rights       the level of labeling on products            control of the food supply      and the objectivity of the regulatory process       although doubts have been raised       economically most studies have found growing gm crops to be beneficial to farmers                  gene flow between gm crops and compatible plants  along with increased use of selective herbicides  can increase the risk of  superweeds  developing       other environmental concerns involve potential impacts on non target organisms  including soil microbes       and an increase in secondary and resistant insect pests            many of the environmental impacts regarding gm crops may take many years to be understood and are also evident in conventional agriculture practices            with the commercialisation of genetically modified fish there are concerns over what the environmental consequences will be if they escape        there are three main concerns over the safety of genetically modified food  whether they may provoke an allergic reaction  whether the genes could transfer from the food into human cells  and whether the genes not approved for human consumption could outcross to other crops       there is a scientific consensus                     that currently available food derived from gm crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food                           but that each gm food needs to be tested on a case by case basis before introduction                 nonetheless  members of the public are less likely than scientists to perceive gm foods as safe                       in popular culture main article  genetics in fiction   genetic engineering genetic

template message   a ribosome is a biological machine that utilizes protein dynamics  some biological machines biological engineering  bioengineering  or bio engineering is the application of principles of biology and the tools of engineering to create usable  tangible  economically viable products     biological engineering employs knowledge and expertise from a number of pure and applied sciences     such as mass and heat transfer  kinetics  biocatalysts  biomechanics  bioinformatics  separation and purification processes  bioreactor design  surface science  fluid mechanics  thermodynamics  and polymer science  it is used in the design of medical devices  diagnostic equipment  biocompatible materials  renewable bioenergy  ecological engineering  agricultural engineering  and other areas that improve the living standards of societies  examples of bioengineering research include bacteria engineered to produce chemicals  new medical imaging technology  portable and rapid disease diagnostic devices  prosthetics  biopharmaceuticals  and tissue engineered organs        bioengineering overlaps substantially with biotechnology and the biomedical sciences    in a way analogous to how various other forms of engineering and technology relate to various other sciences  such as aerospace engineering and other space technology to kinetics and astrophysics    in general  biological engineers  or biomedical engineers  attempt to either mimic biological systems to create products or modify and control biological systems so that they can replace  augment  sustain  or predict chemical and mechanical processes     bioengineers can apply their expertise to other applications of engineering and biotechnology  including genetic modification of plants and microorganisms  bioprocess engineering  and biocatalysis  working with doctors  clinicians  and researchers  bioengineers use traditional engineering principles and techniques and apply them to real world biological and medical problems       contents   history   education   sub disciplines   organizations   references   external links history biological engineering is a science based discipline founded upon the biological sciences in the same way that chemical engineering  electrical engineering  and mechanical engineering    can be based upon chemistry  electricity and magnetism  and classical mechanics  respectively     and it has the same fundamental attention to cost effectiveness as all branches of engineering do   before wwii  biological engineering had just begun being recognized as a branch of engineering  and was a very new concept to people  post wwii  it started to grow more rapidly  partially due to the term  bioengineering  being coined by british scientist and broadcaster heinz wolff in      at the national institute for medical research  wolff graduated that same year and became the director of the division of biological engineering at the university  this was the first time bioengineering was recognized as its own branch at a university  electrical engineering is considered to pioneer this engineering sector due to its work with medical devices and machinery during this time      when engineers and life scientists started working together  they recognized the problem that the engineers didn t know enough about the actual biology behind their work  to resolve this problem  engineers who wanted to get into biological engineering devoted more of their time and studies to the details and processes that go into fields such as biology  psychology  and medicine      the term biological engineering may also be applied to environmental modifications such as surface soil protection  slope stabilization  watercourse and shoreline protection  windbreaks  vegetation barriers including noise barriers and visual screens  and the ecological enhancement of an area  because other engineering disciplines also address living organisms  the term biological engineering can be applied more broadly to include agricultural engineering   the first biological engineering program was created at university of california  san diego in       making it the first biological engineering curriculum in the united states      more recent programs have been launched at mit     and utah state university      many old agricultural engineering departments in universities over the world have re branded themselves as agricultural and biological engineering or agricultural and biosystems engineering  due to biological engineering as a whole being a rapidly developing field with fluid categorization  according to professor doug lauffenburger of mit          biological engineering has a broad base which applies engineering principles to an enormous range of size and complexities of systems  these systems range from the molecular level  molecular biology  biochemistry  microbiology  pharmacology  protein chemistry  cytology  immunology  neurobiology and neuroscience  to cellular and tissue based systems  including devices and sensors   to whole macroscopic organisms  plants  animals   and can even range up to entire ecosystems   education the average length of study is three to five years  and the completed degree is signified as a bachelor of engineering  b s  in engineering   fundamental courses include thermodynamics  bio mechanics  biology  genetic engineering  fluid and mechanical dynamics  kinetics  electronics  and materials properties           sub disciplines  modeling of the spread of disease using cellular automata and nearest

to a teacup    biologists think pufferfish  also known as blowfish  developed their famous  inflatability  because their slow  somewhat clumsy swimming style makes them vulnerable to predators  in lieu of escape  pufferfish use their highly elastic stomachs and the ability to quickly ingest huge amounts of water  and even air when necessary  to turn themselves into a virtually inedible ball several times their normal size  some species also have spines on their skin to make them even less palatable   toxicity  a predator that manages to snag a puffer before it inflates won t feel lucky for long  almost all pufferfish contain tetrodotoxin  a substance that makes them foul tasting and often lethal to fish  to humans  tetrodotoxin is deadly  up to       times more poisonous than cyanide  there is enough toxin in one pufferfish to kill    adult humans  and there is no known antidote   as food  amazingly  the meat of some pufferfish is considered a delicacy  called fugu in japan  it is extremely expensive and only prepared by trained  licensed chefs who know that one bad cut means almost certain death for a customer  in fact  many such deaths occur annually   population  there are more than     species of pufferfish worldwide  most are found in tropical and subtropical ocean waters  but some species live in brackish and even fresh water  they have long  tapered bodies with bulbous heads  some wear wild markings and colors to advertise their toxicity  while others have more muted or cryptic coloring to blend in with their environment   they range in size from the   inch long dwarf or pygmy puffer to the freshwater giant puffer  which can grow to more than   feet in length  they are scaleless fish and usually have rough to spiky skin  all have four teeth that are fused together into a beak like form   diet  the diet of the pufferfish includes mostly invertebrates and algae  large specimens will even crack open and eat clams  mussels  and shellfish with their hard beaks  poisonous puffers are believed to synthesize their deadly toxin from the bacteria in the animals they eat   theats to survival  some species of pufferfish are considered vulnerable due to pollution  habitat loss  and overfishing  but most populations are considered stable   did you know  pufferfish is a delicacy in japan  where it s known as fugu  pufferfish have a

african bush elephant  the african forest elephant  and the asian elephant  elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order proboscidea  extinct members include the mastodons  the family elephantidae also contains several now extinct groups  including the mammoths and straight tusked elephants  african elephants have larger ears and concave backs  whereas asian elephants have smaller ears  and convex or level backs  distinctive features of all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk  tusks  large ear flaps  massive legs  and tough but sensitive skin  the trunk is used for breathing  bringing food and water to the mouth  and grasping objects  tusks  which are derived from the incisor teeth  serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging  the large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication  the pillar like legs carry their great weight   elephants are scattered throughout sub saharan africa  south asia  and southeast asia and are found in different habitats  including savannahs  forests  deserts  and marshes  they are herbivorous  and they stay near water when it is accessible  they are considered to be keystone species  due to their impact on their environments  elephants have a fission fusion society  in which multiple family groups come together to socialise  females  cows  tend to live in family groups  which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring  the groups  which do not include bulls  are led by the  usually  oldest cow  known as the matriarch   males  bulls  leave their family groups when they reach puberty  and may live alone or with other males  adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate  they enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth  which helps them gain dominance over other males as well as reproductive success  calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years  elephants can live up to    years in the wild  they communicate by touch  sight  smell  and sound  elephants use infrasound  and seismic communication over long distances  elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans  they appear to have self awareness  and appear to show empathy for dying and dead family members   african elephants are listed as vulnerable and asian elephants as endangered by the international union for conservation of nature  iucn   one of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade  as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks  other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people  elephants are used as

     probably from a non indo european language  likely phoenician     it is attested in mycenaean greek as e re pa  genitive e re pa to  in linear b syllabic script        as in mycenaean greek  homer used the greek word to mean ivory  but after the time of herodotus  it also referred to the animal     the word  elephant  appears in middle english as olyfaunt  c       and was borrowed from

relatives based on molecular evidence    elephants belong to the family elephantidae  the sole remaining family within the order proboscidea which belongs to the superorder afrotheria  their closest extant relatives are the sirenians  dugongs and manatees  and the hyraxes  with which they share the clade paenungulata within the superorder afrotheria     elephants and sirenians are further grouped in the clade tethytheria      three species of elephants are recognised  the african bush elephant  loxodonta africana  and forest elephant  loxodonta cyclotis  of sub saharan africa  and the asian elephant  elephas maximus  of south and southeast asia      african elephants have larger ears  a concave back  more wrinkled skin  a sloping abdomen  and two finger like extensions at the tip of the trunk  asian elephants have smaller ears  a convex or level back  smoother skin  a horizontal abdomen that occasionally sags in the middle and one extension at the tip of the trunk  the looped ridges on the molars are narrower in the asian elephant while those of the african are more diamond shaped  the asian elephant also has dorsal bumps on its head and some patches of depigmentation on its skin       among african elephants  forest elephants have smaller and more rounded ears and thinner and straighter tusks than bush elephants and are limited in range to the forested areas of western and central africa      both kinds of elephant were traditionally considered to be the same species loxodonta africana  but molecular studies have affirmed their status as separate species              in       dna sequence analysis showed that l  cyclotis is more closely related to the extinct palaeoloxodon antiquus  than it is to l  africana  possibly undermining the genus loxodonta as a whole       evolution and extinct relatives over     extinct members and three major evolutionary radiations of the order proboscidea have been recorded      the earliest proboscids  the african eritherium and phosphatherium of the late paleocene  heralded the first radiation      the eocene included numidotherium  moeritherium  and barytherium from africa  these animals were relatively small and aquatic  later on  genera such as phiomia and palaeomastodon arose  the latter likely inhabited forests and open woodlands  proboscidean diversity declined during the oligocene      one notable species of this epoch was eritreum melakeghebrekristosi of the horn of africa  which may have been an ancestor to several later species      the beginning of the miocene saw the second diversification  with the appearance of the deinotheres and the mammutids  the former were related to barytherium and lived in africa and eurasia      while the latter may have descended from eritreum     and spread to north america       the second radiation was represented by the emergence of the gomphotheres in the miocene      which likely evolved from eritreum     and originated in africa  spreading to every continent except australia and antarctica  members of this group included gomphotherium and platybelodon      the third radiation started in the late miocene and led to the arrival of the elephantids  which descended from  and slowly replaced  the gomphotheres      the african primelephas gomphotheroides gave rise to loxodonta  mammuthus  and elephas  loxodonta branched off earliest around the miocene and pliocene boundary while mammuthus and elephas diverged later during the early pliocene  loxodonta remained in africa while mammuthus and elephas spread to eurasia  and the former reached north america  at the same time  the stegodontids  another proboscidean group descended from gomphotheres  spread throughout asia  including the indian subcontinent  china  southeast asia  and japan  mammutids continued to evolve into new species  such as the american mastodon       at the beginning of the pleistocene  elephantids experienced a high rate of speciation      the pleistocene also saw the arrival of palaeoloxodon namadicus  the largest terrestrial mammal of all time      loxodonta atlantica became the most common species in northern and southern africa but was replaced by elephas iolensis later in the pleistocene  only when elephas disappeared from africa did loxodonta become dominant once again  this time in the form of the modern species  elephas diversified into new species in asia  such as e  hysudricus and e  platycephus      the latter the likely ancestor of the modern asian elephant      mammuthus evolved into several species  including the well known woolly mammoth      interbreeding appears to have been common among elephantid species  which in some cases led to species with three ancestral genetic components  such as the palaeoloxodon antiquus     in the late pleistocene  most proboscidean species vanished during the quaternary glaciation which killed off     of genera weighing over   kg     lb  worldwide       proboscideans experienced several evolutionary trends  such as an increase in size  which led to many giant species that stood up to     cm     ft   in  tall      as with other megaherbivores  including the extinct sauropod dinosaurs  the large size of elephants likely developed to allow them to survive on vegetation with low nutritional value      their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader     the feet were originally plantigrade and developed into a digitigrade stance with cushion pads and the sesamoid bone providing support      early proboscideans developed longer mandibles and smaller craniums while more derived ones developed shorter mandibles  which shifted the head s centre of gravity  the skull grew larger  especially the cranium  while the neck shortened to provide better support for the skull  the increase in size led to the development and elongation of the mobile trunk to provide reach  the number of premolars  incisors and canines decreased     the cheek teeth  molars and premolars  became larger and more specialized  especially after elephants started to switch from c  plants to c  grasses  which caused their teeth to undergo a three fold increase in teeth height as well as substantial multiplication of lamellae after about five million years ago  only in the last million years or so did they return to a diet mainly consisting of c  trees and shrubs          the upper second incisors grew into tusks  which varied in shape from straight  to curved  either upward or downward   to spiralled  depending on the species  some proboscideans developed tusks from their lower incisors     elephants retain certain features from their aquatic ancestry  such as their middle ear anatomy       dwarf species main article  dwarf elephant  skeleton of a cretan dwarf elephant several species of proboscideans lived on islands and experienced insular dwarfism  this occurred primarily during the pleistocene when some elephant populations became isolated by fluctuating sea levels  although dwarf elephants did exist earlier in the pliocene  these elephants likely grew smaller on islands due to a lack of large or viable predator populations and limited resources  by contrast  small mammals such as rodents develop gigantism in these conditions  dwarf proboscideans are known to have lived in indonesia  the channel islands of california  and several islands of the mediterranean       elephas celebensis of sulawesi is believed to have descended from elephas planifrons  palaeoloxodon falconeri of malta and sicily was only     cm    ft   in  and had probably evolved from the straight tusked elephant  other descendants of the straight tusked elephant existed in cyprus  dwarf elephants of uncertain descent lived in crete  cyclades  and dodecanese while dwarf mammoths are known to have lived in sardinia      the columbian mammoth colonised the channel islands and evolved into the pygmy mammoth  this species reached a height of         cm    ft    in

 in  tall at the shoulder and         t          short tons   male african bush elephants are typically     taller than females  whereas male asian elephants are only around     taller than females       bones the skeleton of the elephant is made up of         bones      the vertebrae are connected by tight joints  which limit the backbone s flexibility  african elephants have    pairs of ribs  while asian elephants have    or    pairs       head an elephant s skull is resilient enough to withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head to head collisions  the back of the skull is flattened and spread out  creating arches that protect the brain in every direction      the skull contains air cavities  sinuses  that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength  these cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb like appearance  the cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head  the lower jaw is solid and heavy      because of the size of the head  the neck is relatively short to provide better support     lacking a lacrimal apparatus  the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist  a durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe  the animal s field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes      elephants are considered dichromats     and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light       ears elephant ears have thick bases with thin tips  the ear flaps  or pinnae  contain numerous blood vessels called capillaries  warm blood flows into the capillaries  helping to release excess body heat into the environment  this occurs when the pinnae are still  and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them  larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries  and more heat can be released  of all the elephants  african bush elephants live in the hottest climates  and have the largest ear flaps      elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at   khz  in close proximity to the soprano c        trunk  african bush elephant with its trunk raised  a behaviour often adopted when trumpeting  asian elephant drinking water with trunk the trunk  or proboscis  is a fusion of the nose and upper lip  although in early fetal life  the upper lip and trunk are separated     the trunk is elongated and specialised to become the elephant s most important and versatile appendage  it contains up to         separate muscle fascicles  with no bone and little fat  these paired muscles consist of two major types  superficial  surface  and internal  the former are divided into dorsals  ventrals  and laterals while the latter are divided into transverse and radiating muscles  the muscles of the trunk connect to a bony opening in the skull  the nasal septum is composed of tiny muscle units that stretch horizontally between the nostrils  cartilage divides the nostrils at the base      as a muscular hydrostat  the trunk moves by precisely coordinated muscle contractions  the muscles work both with and against each other  a unique proboscis nerve   formed by the maxillary and facial nerves   runs along both sides of the trunk       elephant trunks have multiple functions  including breathing  olfaction  touching  grasping  and sound production     the animal s sense of smell may be four times as sensitive as that of a bloodhound      the trunk s ability to make powerful twisting and coiling movements allows it to collect food  wrestle with other elephants      and lift up to     kg      lb      it can be used for delicate tasks  such as wiping an eye and checking an orifice      and is capable of cracking a peanut shell without breaking the seed     with its trunk  an elephant can reach items at heights of up to   m     ft  and dig for water under mud or sand      individuals may show lateral preference when grasping with their trunks  some prefer to twist them to the left  others to the right      elephants can suck up water both to drink and to spray on their bodies     an adult asian elephant is capable of holding     l      us gal  of water in its trunk      they will also spray dust or grass on themselves     when underwater  the elephant uses its trunk as a snorkel       the african elephant has two finger like extensions at the tip of the trunk that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth  the asian elephant has only one  and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth      asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks      losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant s survival     although in rare cases  individuals have survived with shortened ones  one elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs  raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips      floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in african bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip       teeth  closeup of the cheek teeth of a dead juvenile bush elephant  asian elephant eating tree bark  using its tusks to peel it off  elephants usually have    teeth  the incisors  known as the tusks     deciduous premolars  and    molars  unlike most mammals  which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth  elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives  the chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant s lifetime  teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals  instead  new teeth grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones  the first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old  the second set of chewing teeth falls out at four to six years old  the third set falls out at      years of age  and set four lasts until       years of age  the fifth set of teeth falls out at the early   s  the sixth  and usually final  set must last the elephant the rest of its life  elephant teeth have loop shaped dental ridges  which are thicker and more diamond shaped in african elephants       tusks the tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw  they replace deciduous milk teeth at      months of age and grow continuously at about    cm    in  a year  a newly developed tusk has a smooth enamel cap that eventually wears off  the dentine is known as ivory and its cross section consists of crisscrossing line patterns  known as  engine turning   which create diamond shaped areas  as a piece of living tissue  a tusk is relatively soft  it is as hard as the mineral calcite  much of the tusk can be seen outside  the rest is in a socket in the skull  at least one third of the tusk contains the pulp and some have nerves stretching to the tip  thus it would be difficult to remove it without harming the animal  when removed  ivory begins to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist  tusks serve multiple purposes  they are used for digging for water  salt  and roots  debarking or marking trees  and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path  when fighting  they are used to attack and defend  and to protect the trunk       like humans  who are typically right  or left handed  elephants are usually right  or left tusked  the dominant tusk  called the master tusk  is generally more worn down  as it is shorter with a rounder tip  for the african elephants  tusks are present in both males and females  and are around the same length in both sexes  reaching up to     cm    ft    in       but those of males tend to be thicker      in earlier times  elephant tusks weighing over     pounds  more than    kg  were not uncommon  though it is rare today to see any over     pounds     kg        in the asian species  only the males have large tusks  female asians have very small tusks  or none at all      tuskless males exist and are particularly common among sri lankan elephants      asian males can have tusks as long as africans   but they are usually slimmer and lighter  the largest recorded was     cm    ft    in  long and weighed    kg     lb   hunting for elephant ivory in africa     and asia     has led to natural selection for shorter tusks         and tusklessness           skin  an african forest elephant covering its skin with mud an elephant s skin is generally very tough  at     cm    in  thick on the back and parts of the head  the skin around the mouth  anus  and inside of the ear is considerably thinner  elephants typically have grey skin  but african elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud  asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation  particularly on the forehead and ears and the areas around them  calves have brownish or reddish hair  especially on the head and back  as elephants mature  their hair darkens and becomes sparser  but dense concentrations of hair and bristles remain on the end of the tail as well as the chin  genitals and the areas around the eyes and ear openings  normally the skin of an asian elephant is covered with more hair than its african counterpart       an elephant uses mud as a sunscreen  protecting its skin from ultraviolet light  although tough  an elephant s skin is very sensitive  without regular mud baths to protect it from burning  insect bites and moisture loss  an elephant s skin suffers serious damage  after bathing  the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust   elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface area to volume ratio  which is many times smaller than that of a human  they have even been observed lifting up their legs  presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air       legs  locomotion  and posture  an asian elephant walking to support the animal s weight  an elephant s limbs are positioned more vertically under the body than in most other mammals  the long bones of the limbs have cancellous bone in place of medullary cavities  this strengthens the bones while still allowing haematopoiesis      both the front and hind limbs can support an elephant s weight  although     is borne by the front      since the limb bones are placed on top of each other and under the body  an elephant can stand still for long periods of time without using much energy  elephants are incapable of rotating their front legs  as the ulna and radius are fixed in pronation  the  palm  of the manus faces backward      the pronator quadratus and the pronator teres are either reduced or absent      the circular feet of an elephant have soft tissues or  cushion pads  beneath the manus or pes  which distribute the weight of the animal      they appear to have a sesamoid  an extra  toe  similar in placement to a giant panda s extra  thumb   that also helps in weight distribution      as many as five toenails can be found on both the front and hind feet       elephants can move both forwards and backwards  but cannot trot  jump  or gallop  they use only two gaits when moving on land  the walk and a faster gait similar to running      in walking  the legs act as pendulums  with the hips and shoulders rising and falling while the foot is planted on the ground  with no  aerial phase   the fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running  although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals  with the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet are on the ground      fast moving elephants appear to  run  with their front legs  but  walk  with their hind legs and can reach a top speed of    km h     mph       at this speed  most other quadrupeds are well into a gallop  even accounting for leg length  spring like kinetics could explain the difference between the motion of elephants and other animals      during locomotion  the cushion pads expand and contract  and reduce both the pain and noise that would come from a very heavy animal moving      elephants are capable swimmers  they have been recorded swimming for up to six hours without touching the bottom  and have travelled as far as    km     mi  at a stretch and at speeds of up to     km h    mph        organs  african elephant heart in a jar the brain of an elephant weighs         kg        lb  compared to     kg    lb  for a human brain  while the elephant brain is larger overall  it is proportionally smaller  at birth  an elephant s brain already weighs        of its adult weight  the cerebrum and cerebellum are well developed  and the temporal lobes are so large that they bulge out laterally      the throat of an elephant appears to contain a pouch where it can store water for later use     the larynx of the elephant is the largest known among mammals  the vocal folds are long and are attached close to the epiglottis base  when comparing an elephant s vocal folds to those of a human  an elephant s are longer  thicker  and have a larger cross sectional area  in addition  they are tilted at    degrees and positioned more anteriorly than a human s vocal folds       the heart of an elephant weighs       kg        lb   it has a double pointed apex  an unusual trait among mammals      in addition  the ventricles separate near the top of the heart  a trait they share with sirenians      when standing  the elephant s heart beats approximately    times per minute  unlike many other animals  the heart rate speeds up by   to    beats per minute when the elephant is lying down      the blood vessels in most of the body are wide and thick and can withstand high blood pressures      the lungs are attached to the diaphragm  and breathing relies mainly on the diaphragm rather than the expansion of the ribcage      connective tissue exists in place of the pleural cavity  this may allow the animal to deal with the pressure differences when its body is underwater and its trunk is breaking the surface for air      although this explanation has been questioned      another possible function for this adaptation is that it helps the animal suck up water through the trunk      elephants inhale mostly through the trunk  although some air goes through the mouth  they have a hindgut fermentation system  and their large and small intestines together reach    m      ft  in length  the majority of an elephant s food intake goes undigested despite the process lasting up to a day       a male elephant s testes are located internally near the kidneys      the elephant s penis can reach a length of     cm     in  and a diameter of    cm    in  at the base  it is s shaped when fully erect and has a y shaped orifice  the female has a well developed clitoris at up to    cm     in   the vulva is located between the hind legs instead of near the tail as in most mammals  determining pregnancy status can be difficult due to the animal s large abdominal cavity  the female s mammary glands occupy the space between the front legs  which puts the suckling calf within reach of the female s trunk      elephants have a unique organ  the temporal gland  located in both sides of the head  this organ is associated with sexual behaviour  and males secrete a fluid from it when in musth      females have also been observed with secretions from the temporal glands       core body temperature the core body temperature averages       c        f   similar to that of a human  like all mammals  an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme

prehensile trunk for foraging the african bush elephant can be found in habitats as diverse as dry savannahs  deserts  marshes  and lake shores  and in elevations from sea level to mountain areas above the snow line  forest elephants mainly live in equatorial forests but will enter gallery forests and ecotones between forests and savannahs      asian elephants prefer areas with a mix of grasses  low woody plants  and trees  primarily inhabiting dry thorn scrub forests in southern india and sri lanka and evergreen forests in malaya      elephants are herbivorous and will eat leaves  twigs  fruit  bark  grass and roots      they are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother s feces to digest vegetation      african elephants are mostly browsers while asian elephants are mainly grazers  they can consume as much as     kg      lb  of food and    l     us gal  of water in a day  elephants tend to stay near water sources      major feeding bouts take place in the morning  afternoon and night  at midday  elephants rest under trees and may doze off while standing  sleeping occurs at night while the animal is lying down          elephants average     hours of sleep per day      both males and family groups typically move       km       mi  a day  but distances as far as        km         mi  have been recorded in the etosha region of

waterholes dry up       because of their large size  elephants have a huge impact on their environments and are considered keystone species  their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands  when they dig for water during drought  they create waterholes that can be used by other animals  they can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them  at mount elgon  elephants excavate caves that are used by ungulates  hyraxes  bats  birds and insects      elephants are important seed dispersers  african forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds  with either no effect or a positive effect on germination  the seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances      in asian forests  large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal  this ecological niche cannot be filled by the next largest herbivore  the tapir      because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested  their dung can provide food for other animals  such as dung beetles and monkeys      elephants can have a negative impact on ecosystems  at murchison falls national park in uganda  the overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands  their weight can compact the soil  which causes the rain to run off  leading to erosion        forest elephant in

of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators      though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers      calves may be preyed on by lions  spotted hyenas  and wild dogs in africa     and tigers in asia      the lions of savuti  botswana  have adapted to hunting elephants  mostly juveniles or sub adults  during the dry season  and a pride of    lions has been normally recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years  and a bull of about    years in an exceptional case          elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller predators like leopards  which have not been recorded killing calves   they react to leopards less fearfully and more aggressively      elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites  particularly nematodes  compared to other herbivores  this is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads       social organisation female elephants spend their entire lives in tight knit matrilineal family groups  some of which are made up of more than ten members  including three mothers and their dependent offspring  and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female      she remains leader of the group until death     or if she no longer has the energy for the role      a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died  the levels of faecal corticosterone   stress hormone   dramatically increased in the surviving elephants      when her tenure is over  the matriarch s eldest daughter takes her place  this occurs even if her sister is present      one study found that younger matriarchs are more likely than older ones to under react to severe danger      family groups may split after becoming too large for the available resources       the social circle of the female elephant does not necessarily end with the small family unit  in the case of elephants in amboseli national park  kenya  a female s life involves interaction with other families  clans  and subpopulations  families may associate and bond with each other  forming what are known as bond groups which typically made of two family groups  during the dry season  elephant families may cluster together and form another level of social organisation known as the clan  groups within these clans do not form strong bonds  but they defend their dry season ranges against other clans  there are typically nine groups in a clan  the amboseli elephant population is further divided into the  central  and  peripheral  subpopulations       some elephant populations in india and sri lanka have similar basic social organisations  there appear to be cohesive family units and loose aggregations  they have been observed to have  nursing units  and  juvenile care units   in southern india  elephant populations may contain family groups  bond groups and possibly clans  family groups tend to be small  consisting of one or two adult females and their offspring  a group containing more than two adult females plus offspring is known as a  joint family   malay elephant populations have even smaller family units  and do not have any social organisation higher than a family or bond group      groups of african forest elephants typically consist of one adult female with one to three offspring  these groups appear to interact with each other  especially at forest clearings       the social life of the adult male is very different  as he matures  a male spends more time at the edge of his group and associates with outside males or even other families  at amboseli  young males spend over     of their time away from their families when they are        when males permanently leave  they either live alone or with other males  the former is typical of bulls in dense forests  asian males are usually solitary  but occasionally form groups of two or more individuals  the largest consisted of seven bulls  larger bull groups consisting of over    members occur only among african bush elephants  the largest of which numbered up to     individuals  bulls only return to the herd to breed or to socialize  they do not provide prenatal care to their offspring but rather play a fatherly role to younger bulls to show dominance       male elephants can be quite sociable when not competing for dominance or mates  and will form long term relationships      a dominance hierarchy exists among males  whether they range socially or solitarily  dominance depends on the age  size and sexual condition      and when in groups  males follow the lead of the dominant bull  young bulls may seek out the company and leadership of older  more experienced males      whose presence appears to control their aggression and prevent them from exhibiting  deviant  behaviour      adult males and females come together for reproduction  bulls associate with family groups if an oestrous cow is present        a family of african bush elephants  note the protected position of the calves in the middle of the group     lone bull  adult male elephants spend much of their time alone or in single sex groups     male elephants sparring  sexual behaviour musth main article  musth  bull in musth adult males enter a state of increased testosterone known as musth  in a population in southern india  males first enter musth at the age of     but it is not very intense until they are older than     at amboseli  bulls under    do not go into musth  while half of those aged       and all those over    do  young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season  january may   while older bulls go through it during the wet season  june december   the main characteristic of a bull s musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face  he may urinate with his penis still in his sheath  which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs  behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging  picking at the ground with the tusks  marking  rumbling and waving only one ear at a time  this can last from a day to four months       males become extremely aggressive during musth  size is the determining factor in agonistic encounters when the individuals have the same condition  in contests between musth and non musth individuals  musth bulls win the majority of the time  even when the non musth bull is larger  a male may stop showing signs of musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank  those of equal rank tend to avoid each other  agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays  chases  and minor sparring with the tusks  serious fights are rare       mating  bull mating with a member of a female group elephants are polygynous breeders       and copulations are most frequent during the peak of the wet season       a cow in oestrus releases chemical signals  pheromones  in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate  a bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response  which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ            the oestrous cycle of a cow lasts       weeks with a     week follicular phase and an    to    week luteal phase  while most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase  elephants have two  the first  or anovulatory  surge  could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent  but ovulation does not occur until the second  or ovulatory  surge       fertility rates in cows decline around       years of age       bulls engage in a behaviour known as mate guarding  where they follow oestrous females and defend them from other males       most mate guarding is done by musth males  and females actively seek to be guarded by them  particularly older ones       thus these bulls have more reproductive success      musth appears to signal to females the condition of the male  as weak or injured males do not have normal musths       for young females  the approach of an older bull can be intimidating  so her relatives stay nearby to provide support and reassurance       during copulation  the male lays his trunk over the female s back       the penis is very mobile  being able to move independently of the pelvis       prior to mounting  it curves forward and upward  copulation lasts about    seconds and does not involve pelvic thrusting or ejaculatory pause       elephant sperm must swim close to   m      ft  to reach the egg  by comparison  human sperm has to swim around only      mm       in         homosexual behaviour is frequent in both sexes  as in heterosexual interactions  this involves mounting  male elephants sometimes stimulate each other by playfighting and  championships  may form between old bulls and younger males  female same sex behaviours have been documented only in captivity where they are known to masturbate one another with their trunks        birth and development  an african forest elephant mother bathing with her calf gestation in elephants typically lasts around two years with interbirth intervals usually lasting four to five years  births tend to take place during the wet season       calves are born    cm     in  tall and weigh around     kg      lb        typically  only a single young is born  but twins sometimes occur            the relatively long pregnancy is maintained by five corpus luteums  as opposed to one in most mammals  and gives the foetus more time to develop  particularly the brain and trunk       as such  newborn elephants are precocial and quickly stand and walk to follow their mother and family herd       a new calf is usually the centre of attention for herd members  adults and most of the other young will gather around the newborn  touching and caressing it with their trunks  for the first few days  the mother is intolerant of other herd members near her young  alloparenting   where a calf is cared for by someone other than its mother   takes place in some family groups  allomothers are typically two to twelve years old        for the first few days  the newborn is unsteady on its feet  and needs the support of its mother  it relies on touch  smell  and hearing  as its eyesight is poor  it has little precise control over its trunk  which wiggles around and may cause it to trip  by its second week of life  the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk  after its first month  a calf can pick up  hold  and put objects in its mouth  but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth  it is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her        for its first three months  a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition  after which it begins to forage for vegetation and can use its trunk to collect water  at the same time  improvements in lip and leg coordination occur  calves continue to suckle at the same rate as before until their sixth month  after which they become more independent when feeding  by nine months  mouth  trunk and foot coordination is perfected  after a year  a calf s abilities to groom  drink  and feed itself are fully developed  it still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year  suckling bouts tend to last     min hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older  suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate  body condition and reproductive ability        play behaviour in calves differs between the sexes  females run or chase each other while males play fight  the former are sexually mature by the age of nine years      while the latter become mature around       years      adulthood starts at about    years of age in both sexes            elephants have long lifespans  reaching       years of age      lin wang  a captive male asian elephant  lived for    years        predators a full grown elephant has no natural predators due to their massive size  lions  tigers  hyenas  wild dogs and even crocodiles will attack calves  mothers always keep a close eye on thair calves  but they also get watched by the other females in the herd  when a predator is near  the adult females gathers together with the calves in the centre and charge if the predator doesn t back down  bulls are powerful and aggressive to be threatened towards a predator and serve extra protection to the herd nearby   communication  asian elephants greeting each other by inter twining their trunks touching is an important form of communication among elephants  individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks  the latter also occurs during mild competition  older elephants use trunk slaps  kicks  and shoves to discipline younger ones  individuals of any age and sex will touch each other s mouths  temporal glands  and genitals  particularly during meetings or when excited  this allows individuals to pick up chemical cues  touching is especially important for mother calf communication  when moving  elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side by side or with their tails if the calf is behind them  if a calf wants to rest  it will press against its mother s front legs and when it wants to suckle  it will touch her breast or leg        visual displays mostly occur in agonistic situations  elephants will try to appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears  they may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears  as well as throwing dust and vegetation  they are usually bluffing when performing these actions  excited elephants may raise their trunks  submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks  as well as flatten their ears against their necks  while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a v shape        elephants produce several sounds  usually through the larynx  though some may be modified by the trunk       perhaps the most well known call is the trumpet which is made by blowing through the trunk  trumpeting is made during excitement  distress or aggression            fighting elephants may roar or squeal  and wounded ones may bellow       rumbles are produced during mild arousal      and some appear to be infrasonic       these calls occur at frequencies less than    hz       infrasonic calls are important  particularly for long distance communication       in both asian and african elephants  for asian elephants  these calls have a frequency of       hz  with sound pressure levels of       db and last       seconds       for african elephants  calls range from    to    hz with sound pressure levels as high as     db  allowing communication for many kilometres  with a possible maximum range of around    km    mi         file loxodonta africana oral rumble visualized with acoustic camera    fps    pone         s    ogv rumble visualised with acoustic camera at amboseli  several different infrasonic calls have been identified  a greeting rumble is emitted by members of a family group after having been separated for several hours  contact calls are soft  unmodulated sounds made by individuals that have been separated from their group and may be responded to with a  contact answer  call that starts out loud  but becomes softer  a  let s go  soft rumble is emitted by the matriarch to signal to the other herd members that it is time to move to another spot  bulls in musth emit a distinctive  low frequency pulsated rumble nicknamed the  motorcycle   musth rumbles may be answered by the  female chorus   a low frequency  modulated chorus produced by several cows  a loud postcopulatory call may be made by an oestrous cow after mating  when a cow has mated  her family may produce calls of excitement known as the  mating pandemonium         from various experiments  the elephant larynx is shown to produce various and complex vibratory phenomena  during in vivo situations  these phenomena could be triggered when the vocal folds and vocal tract interact to raise or lower the fundamental frequency       one of the vibratory phenomena that occurred inside the larynx is alternating a p  anterior posterior  and p a traveling waves  which happened due to the unusual larynx layout  this can be characterized by its unique glottal opening closing pattern  when the trachea is at pressure of approximately   kpa  phonation begins in the larynx and the laryngeal tissue starts to vibrate at approximately    kpa  vocal production mechanisms at certain frequencies are similar to that of humans and other mammals and the laryngeal tissues are subjected to self maintained oscillations  two biomechanical features can trigger these traveling wave patterns  which are a low fundamental frequency and in the vocal folds  increasing longitudinal tension       elephants are known to communicate with seismics  vibrations produced by impacts on the earth s surface or acoustical waves that travel through it  they appear to rely on their leg and shoulder bones to transmit the signals to the middle ear  when detecting seismic signals  the animals lean forward and put more weight on their larger front feet  this is known as the  freezing behaviour   elephants possess several adaptations suited for seismic communication  the cushion pads of the feet contain cartilaginous nodes and have similarities to the acoustic fat found in marine mammals like toothed whales and sirenians  a unique sphincter like muscle around the ear canal constricts the passageway  thereby dampening acoustic signals and allowing the animal to hear more seismic signals       elephants appear to use seismics for a number of purposes  an individual running or mock charging can create seismic signals that can be heard at great distances       when detecting the seismics of an alarm call signalling danger from predators  elephants enter a defensive posture and family groups will pack together  seismic waveforms produced by locomotion appear to travel distances of up to    km     mi  while those from vocalisations travel    km     mi         intelligence and cognition main article  elephant cognition file insightful problem solving in an asian elephant pone         s    ogv elephant rolling a block to allow it to reach food elephants exhibit mirror self recognition  an indication of self awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins       one study of a captive female asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs  this individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating when re tested with the same visual pairs a year later       elephants are among the species known to use tools  an asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters       tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees  elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory  this could have a factual basis  they possibly have cognitive maps to allow them to remember large scale spaces over long periods of time  individuals appear to be able to keep track of the current location of their family members       scientists debate the extent to which elephants feel emotion  they appear to show interest in the bones of their own kind  regardless of whether they are related       as with chimps and dolphins  a dying or dead elephant may elicit attention and aid from others  including those from other groups  this has been interpreted as expressing  concern        however  others would dispute such an interpretation as being anthropomorphic            the oxford companion to animal behaviour        advised that  one is well advised to study the behaviour rather than attempting to get at any underlying emotion         conservation status distribution of elephants  african elephant  asian elephant african elephants were listed as vulnerable by the international union for conservation of

elephants for their ivory  meat and hides has been one of the major threats to their existence       historically  numerous cultures made ornaments and other works of art from elephant ivory  and its use rivalled that of gold       the ivory trade contributed to the african elephant population decline in the late   th century       this prompted international bans on ivory imports  starting with the united states in june       and followed by bans in other north american countries  western european countries  and japan       around the same time  kenya destroyed all its ivory stocks       cites approved an international ban on ivory that went into effect in january       following the bans  unemployment rose in india and china  where the ivory industry was important economically  by contrast  japan and hong kong  which were also part of the industry  were able to adapt and were not badly affected       zimbabwe  botswana  namibia  zambia  and malawi wanted to continue the ivory trade and were allowed to  since their local elephant populations were healthy  but only if their supplies were from elephants that had been culled or died of natural causes        the ban allowed the elephant to recover in parts of africa       in january           elephants in bouba njida national park  cameroon  were killed by chadian raiders       this has been called  one of the worst concentrated killings  since the ivory ban       asian elephants are potentially less vulnerable to the ivory trade  as females usually lack tusks  still  members of the species have been killed for their ivory in some areas  such as periyar national park in india       china was the biggest market for poached ivory but announced they would phase out the legal domestic manufacture and sale of ivory products in may       and in september       china and the united states said  they would enact a nearly complete ban on the import and export of ivory  due to causes of extinction        other threats to elephants include habitat destruction and fragmentation       the asian elephant lives in areas with some of the highest human populations  because they need larger amounts of land than other sympatric terrestrial mammals  they are the first to be affected by human encroachment  in extreme cases  elephants may be confined to small islands of forest among human dominated landscapes  elephants cannot coexist with humans in agricultural areas due to their size and food requirements  elephants commonly trample and consume crops  which contributes to conflicts with humans  and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result  mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation       one proposed solution is the provision of  urban corridors  which allow the animals access to key areas        association with humans working animal see also  captive elephants  working elephant as transport elephants have been working animals since at least the indus valley civilization      and continue to be used in modern times  there were               working elephants employed in asia in       these animals are typically captured from the wild when they are       years old when they can be trained quickly and easily  and will have a longer working life       they were traditionally captured with traps and lassos  but since       tranquillisers have been used        individuals of the asian species have been often trained as working animals  asian elephants perform tasks such as hauling loads into remote areas  moving logs to rivers and roads  transporting tourists around national parks  pulling wagons  and leading religious processions       in northern thailand  the animals are used to digest coffee beans for black ivory coffee       they are valued over mechanised tools because they can work in relatively deep water  require relatively little maintenance  need only vegetation and water as fuel and can be trained to memorise specific tasks  elephants can be trained to respond to over    commands       musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous to work with and are chained and semi starved until the condition passes       in india  many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse  they and other captive elephants are thus protected under the prevention of cruelty to animals act of             in both myanmar and thailand  deforestation and other economic factors have resulted in sizable populations of unemployed elephants resulting in health problems for the elephants themselves as well as economic and safety problems for the people amongst whom they live             the practice of working elephants has also been attempted in africa  the taming of african elephants in the belgian congo began by decree of leopold ii of belgium during the   th century and continues to the present with the api elephant domestication centre        warfare main article  war elephant see also  execution by elephant  battle of zama by henri paul motte       historically  elephants were considered formidable instruments of war  they were equipped with armour to protect their sides  and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they were large enough  war elephants were trained to grasp an enemy soldier and toss him to the person riding on them or to pin the soldier to the ground and impale him        one of the earliest references to war elephants is in the indian epic mahabharata  written in the  th century bc  but said to describe events between the   th and  th centuries bc   they were not used as much as horse drawn chariots by either the pandavas or kauravas  during the magadha kingdom  which began in the  th century bc   elephants began to achieve greater cultural importance than horses  and later indian kingdoms used war elephants extensively        of them were used in the nandas   th and  th centuries bc  army while       may have been used in the mauryan army  between the  th and  nd centuries bc   the arthashastra  written around     bc  advised the mauryan government to reserve some forests for wild elephants for use in the army  and to execute anyone who killed them       from south asia  the use of elephants in warfare spread west to persia      and east to southeast asia       the persians used them during the achaemenid empire  between the  th and  th centuries bc       while southeast asian states first used war elephants possibly as early as the  th century bc and continued to the   th century        in his     b c  indian campaign  alexander the great confronted elephants for the first time  and suffered heavy casualties  among the reasons for the refusal of the rank and file macedonian soldiers to continue the indian conquest were rumors of even larger elephant armies in india       alexander trained his foot soldiers to injure the animals and cause them to panic during wars with both the persians and indians  ptolemy  who was one of alexander s generals  used corps of asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of egypt  which began in     bc   his son and successor ptolemy ii  who began his rule in     bc  obtained his supply of elephants further south in nubia  from then on  war elephants were employed in the mediterranean and north africa throughout the classical period  the greek king pyrrhus used elephants in his attempted invasion of rome in     bc  while they frightened the roman horses  they were not decisive and pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle  the carthaginian general hannibal took elephants across the alps during his war with the romans and reached the po valley in     bc with all of them alive  but they later succumbed to disease        overall  elephants owed their initial successes to the element of surprise and to the fear that their great size invoked  with time  strategists devised counter measures and war elephants turned into an expensive liability and were hardly ever used by romans and parthians        zoos and circuses see also  captive elephants elephants were historically kept for display in the menageries of ancient egypt  china  greece  and rome  the romans in particular pitted them against humans and other animals in gladiator events  in the modern era  elephants have traditionally been a major part of zoos and circuses around the world  in circuses  they are trained to perform tricks  the most famous circus elephant was probably jumbo            september        who was a major attraction in the barnum   bailey circus       these animals do not reproduce well in captivity  due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles  asian elephants were always more common than their african counterparts in modern zoos and circuses  after cites listed the asian elephant under appendix i in       the number of african elephants in zoos increased in the     s  although the import of asians continued  subsequently  the us received many of its captive african elephants from zimbabwe  which had an overabundance of the animals       as of       around       asian and     african elephants were kept in zoos and circuses  the largest captive population is in north america  which has an estimated     asian and     african elephants  about     asians and     africans are known to exist in europe  and japan has around    asians and    africans        keeping elephants in zoos has met with some controversy  proponents of zoos argue that they offer researchers easy access to the animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats  as well as safekeeping for the species  critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress       elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth  trunk swaying  or route tracing  this has been observed in     of individuals in uk zoos       elephants in european zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only    years  although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild        the use of elephants in circuses has also been controversial  the humane society of the united states has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals       in testimony to a us federal court in       barnum   bailey circus ceo kenneth feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears  under their chins and on their legs with metal tipped prods  called bull hooks or ankus  feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device  known as a hot shot or electric prod  on an elephant  despite this  he denied that any of these practices harm elephants       some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment  ralph helfer is known to have relied on gentleness and

leadership  sociability  nurturance and loyalty                 several cultural references emphasise the elephant s size and exotic uniqueness  for instance  a  white elephant  is a byword for something expensive  useless  and bizarre       the expression  elephant in the room  refers to an obvious truth that is ignored or otherwise unaddressed       the story of the blind men and an elephant teaches that reality can be observed from different perspectives        elephants have been represented in art since paleolithic times  africa  in particular  contains many rock paintings and engravings of the animals  especially in the sahara and southern africa       in asia  the animals are depicted as motifs in hindu and buddhist shrines and temples       elephants were often difficult to portray by people with no first hand experience of them       the ancient romans  who kept the animals in captivity  depicted anatomically accurate elephants on mosaics in tunisia and sicily  at the beginning of the middle ages  when europeans had little to no access to the animals  elephants were portrayed more like fantasy creatures  they were often depicted with horse  or bovine like bodies with trumpet like trunks and tusks like a boar  some were even given hooves  elephants were commonly featured in motifs by the stonemasons of the gothic churches  as more elephants began to be sent to european kings as gifts during the   th century  depictions of them became more accurate  including one made by leonardo da vinci  despite this  some europeans continued to portray them in a more stylised fashion       max ernst s      surrealist painting  the elephant celebes  depicts an elephant as a silo with a trunk like hose protruding from it        elephants have been the subject of religious beliefs  the mbuti people of central africa believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants       similar ideas existed among other african societies  who believed that their chiefs would be reincarnated as elephants  during the   th century ad  the people of igbo ukwu  near the niger delta  buried their leaders with elephant tusks       the animals  religious importance is only totemic in africa      but is much more significant in asia  in sumatra  elephants have been associated with lightning  likewise in hinduism  they are linked with thunderstorms as airavata  the father of all elephants  represents both lightning and rainbows       one of the most important hindu deities  the elephant headed ganesha  is ranked equal with the supreme gods shiva  vishnu  and brahma       ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that he can give people success as well as grant them their desires       in buddhism  buddha is said to have been a white elephant reincarnated as a human       in islamic tradition  the year     when muhammad was born is known as the year of the elephant       elephants were thought to be religious themselves by the romans  who believed that they worshipped the sun and stars        elephants are ubiquitous in western popular culture as emblems of the exotic  especially since   as with the giraffe  hippopotamus and rhinoceros   there are no similar animals familiar to western audiences       the use of the elephant as a symbol of the u s  republican party began with an      cartoon by thomas nast       as characters  elephants are most common in children s stories  in which they are generally cast as models of exemplary behaviour  they are typically surrogates for humans with ideal human values  many stories tell of isolated young elephants returning to a close knit community  such as  the elephant s child  from rudyard kipling s just so stories  disney s dumbo  and kathryn and

national park   what is the african elephant  african elephants are the largest land animals on earth  they are slightly larger than their asian cousins and can be identified by their larger ears that look somewhat like the continent of africa   asian elephants have smaller  rounded ears    african elephants are a keystone species  meaning they play a critical role in their ecosystem  also known as  ecosystem engineers   elephants shape their habitat in many ways  during the dry season  they use their tusks to dig up dry riverbeds and create watering holes many animals can drink from  their dung is full of seeds  helping plants spread across the environment and it makes pretty good habitat for dung beetles too  in the forest  their feasting on trees and shrubs creates pathways for smaller animals to move through  and in the savanna  they uproot trees and eat saplings  which helps keep the landscape open for zebras and other plains animals to thrive   african elephants are sometimes categorized into savanna elephants and forest elephants  there are some physical and genetic differences  but scientists are still arguing over whether the differences are big enough to call them separate species  currently  most still consider them same species  loxodonta africana   trunks and tusks elephant ears radiate heat to help keep these large animals cool  but sometimes the african heat is too much  elephants are fond of water and enjoy showering by sucking water into their trunks and spraying it all over themselves  afterwards  they often spray their skin with a protective coating of dust   an elephant s trunk is actually a long nose used for smelling  breathing  trumpeting  drinking  and also for grabbing things especially a potential meal  the trunk alone contains about        muscles  african elephants have two fingerlike features on the end of their trunk that they can use to grab small items   asian elephants have just one    both male and female african elephants have tusks  which are continuously growing teeth  they use these tusks to dig for food and water and strip bark from trees  males  whose tusks tend to be larger than females   also use their tusks to battle one another   diet elephants eat roots  grasses  fruit  and bark  and they eat a lot of these things  an adult elephant can consume up to     pounds of food in a single day  these hungry animals do not sleep much  and they roam over great distances while foraging for the large quantities of food that they require to sustain their massive bodies   african elephants range throughout the savannas of sub saharan africa and the rainforests of central and west africa  the continent s northernmost elephants are found in sahel area of mali  the small  nomadic herd of mali elephants migrates in a circular route through the desert in search of water   because elephants eat so much  they re increasingly coming into contact with humans  an elephant can destroy an entire season of crops in a single night a huge blow to a farmer  who may want to retaliate  there are a number of conservation programs working with farmers to help them protect their crops  elephants are so smart that they can learn to get around electric fences quickly   and provide compensation when an elephant does raid them   herds elephants are matriarchal  meaning they live in female led groups  the matriarch is usually the biggest and oldest  she presides over a multi generational herd that includes other females  called cows  and their young  adult males  called bulls  tend to roam on their own  sometimes forming smaller  more loosely associated all male groups   having a baby elephant is a serious commitment  elephants have a longer pregnancy than any other mammal almost    months  cows usually give birth to one calf every two to four years  at birth  elephants already weigh some     pounds and stand about three feet tall   threats to survival poaching for the ivory trade is the biggest threat to african elephants  survival  before the europeans began colonizing africa  there may have been as many as    million  the arrival of europeans kicked off the commercial ivory trend  in which tusks were used for piano keys  billiards balls  combs  and all kinds of other items  by the early   th century  elephant numbers had dropped to    million  hunting continued to increase  by       their numbers were down to     million   between      and       hunting and poaching put the african elephant at risk of extinction  reducing its population by another half  today  the international union for conservation of nature lists them as vulnerable to extinction  as few as         remain today   because poachers target elephants for their tusks  these years of violence have also had an expecting result  african elephants are evolving to become tuskless  studies across the continent have shown that regions with historically higher levels of poaching now have higher than usual proportions of tuskless females  researchers are still trying to figure out how this evolution could affect the species in the long term   though the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora  cites  banned the global commercial ivory trade in       the illegal tusk trade remains strong  and poaching continues across the continent  in       the great elephant census revealed that savanna elephant numbers were declining at a rate of   percent or        elephants a year   compounding the problem is how long it takes for elephants to reproduce  with reproduction rates hovering around   to   percent  there are simply not enough calves being born to make up for the losses from poaching   african elephants are also losing their habitat as the human population grows and people convert land for agriculture and development  elephants need a lot of room to roam  so habitat destruction and fragmentation not only makes it harder for them to find food  water  and each other  but it also puts them in increased conflict with humans a dangerous prospect for both   conservation african elephants are protected to varying degrees in all the countries of their geographic range  they re also protected under international environmental agreements  cites and the convention on the conservation of migratory species  there have been recent efforts to bring re legalize the international trade in ivory  but those so far have failed   conservation groups and governments have worked to set aside land for wildlife including corridors that connect those protected lands  still  researchers believe that up to    percent of elephants  range is on unprotected land   to curb poaching  stopping the illegal trade is key  advocates have launched campaigns that address both the supply side  poaching  and the demand side  people who buy ivory   there have been some breakthroughs in recent years  especially on the demand side  in       china believed to be the world s biggest illegal and legal ivory market agreed to a  near complete  ban on the domestic trade of ivory  since the ban went into effect  public demand for ivory seems to have fallen   on the supply side  protecting elephants from poaching also requires a local approach  in       a study showed that the suffering of elephants is tied to that of the humans living nearby  regions with high levels of poverty and corruption are more likely to have higher poaching rates  this suggests that helping communities develop sustainable livelihoods could reduce the lure of poaching   stronger law enforcement and reducing corruption are also important   did you know  elephants recognize themselves in a mirror something few animals are known to do  national geographic

the center of the solar system  it is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma          heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core  radiating the energy mainly as light and infrared radiation  it is by far the most important source of energy for life on earth  its diameter is about      million kilometres          miles   or     times that of earth  and its mass is about         times that of earth  it accounts for about        of the total mass of the solar system      roughly three quarters of the sun s mass consists of hydrogen         the rest is mostly helium         with much smaller quantities of heavier elements  including oxygen  carbon  neon  and iron       the sun is a g type main sequence star  g v  based on its spectral class  as such  it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf  its light is closer to white than yellow   it formed approximately     billion a          years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud  most of this matter gathered in the center  whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the solar system  the central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core  it is thought that almost all stars form by this process   in its core the sun currently fuses about     million tons of hydrogen into helium every second  converting   million tons of matter into energy every second as a result  this energy  which can take between        and         years to escape the core  is the source of the sun s light and heat  when hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which the sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium  its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand  eventually transforming the sun into a red giant  it is calculated that the sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of mercury and venus  and render earth uninhabitable   but not for about five billion years  after this  it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf  and no longer produce energy by fusion  but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion   the enormous effect of the sun on earth has been recognized since prehistoric times  the sun has been regarded by

sinne  dutch zon  low german s nn  standard german sonne  bavarian sunna  old norse sunna and gothic sunn   all these words stem from proto germanic  sunn n          this is ultimately related to the word for  sun  in other branches of the indo european language family  though in most cases a nominative stem with an l is found  rather than the genitive stem in n  as for example in latin s l  greek       h lios  welsh haul and russian        solntse  pronounced sontse   as well as  with  l   r  sanskrit      sv r and persian     xvar  indeed  the l stem survived in proto germanic as well  as  s welan  which gave rise to gothic sauil  alongside sunn   and old norse prosaic s l  alongside poetic sunna   and through it the words for  sun  in the modern scandinavian languages  swedish and danish solen  icelandic s lin  etc       in english  the greek and latin words occur in poetry as personifications of the sun  helios   hi li s  and sol   s l         while in science fiction  sol  may be used as a name for the sun to distinguish it from other stars  the term  sol  with a lower case  s  is used by planetary astronomers for the duration of a solar day on another planet such as mars       the principal adjectives for the sun in english are sunny for sunlight and  in technical contexts  solar   so l r      from latin sol       the latter found in terms such as solar day  solar eclipse and solar system  occasionally sol system   from the greek helios comes the rare adjective heliac   hi li k        the english weekday name sunday stems from old english sunnand g  sun s day   a

star that comprises about        of the mass of the solar system  the sun has an absolute magnitude of        estimated to be brighter than about     of the stars in the milky way  most of which are red dwarfs          the sun is a population i  or heavy element rich  b  star      the formation of the sun may have been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby supernovae      this is suggested by a high abundance of heavy elements in the solar system  such as gold and uranium  relative to the abundances of these elements in so called population ii  heavy element poor  stars  the heavy elements could most plausibly have been produced by endothermic nuclear reactions during a supernova  or by transmutation through neutron absorption within a massive second generation star       the sun is by far the brightest object in the earth s sky  with an apparent magnitude of                 this is about    billion times brighter than the next brightest star  sirius  which has an apparent magnitude of        one astronomical unit  about             km             mi  is defined as the mean distance of the sun s center to earth s center  though the distance varies as earth moves from perihelion in january to aphelion in july      at this average distance  light travels from the sun s horizon to earth s horizon in about   minutes and    seconds  while light from the closest points of the sun and earth takes about two seconds less  the energy of this sunlight supports almost all life c  on earth by photosynthesis      and drives earth s climate and weather   the sun does not have a definite boundary  but its density decreases exponentially with increasing height above the photosphere      for the purpose of measurement  the sun s radius is considered to be the distance from its center to the edge of the photosphere  the apparent visible surface of the sun      by this measure  the sun is a near perfect sphere with an oblateness estimated at about   millionths      which means that its polar diameter differs from its equatorial diameter by only    kilometres      mi       the tidal effect of the planets is weak and does not significantly affect the shape of the sun      the sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles  this differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the coriolis force due to the sun s rotation  in a frame of reference defined by the stars  the rotational period is approximately      days at the equator and      days at the poles  viewed from earth as it orbits the sun  the apparent rotational period of the sun at its equator is about    days      viewed from a vantage point above its north pole  the sun rotates counterclockwise around its axis of spin  d       sunlight main article  sunlight  the sun  as seen from the earth s surface the solar constant is the amount of power that the sun deposits per unit area that is directly exposed to sunlight  the solar constant is equal to approximately       w m   watts per square meter  at a distance of one astronomical unit  au  from the sun  that is  on or near earth       sunlight on the surface of earth is attenuated by earth s atmosphere  so that less power arrives at the surface  closer to       w m   in clear conditions when the sun is near the zenith      sunlight at the top of earth s atmosphere is composed  by total energy  of about     infrared light      visible light  and     ultraviolet light      the atmosphere in particular filters out over     of solar ultraviolet  especially at the shorter wavelengths      solar ultraviolet radiation ionizes earth s dayside upper atmosphere  creating the electrically conducting ionosphere       the sun s color is white  with a cie color space index near             when viewed from space or when the sun is high in the sky  and the solar radiance per wavelength peaks in the green portion of the spectrum          when the sun is low in the sky  atmospheric scattering renders the sun yellow  red  orange  or magenta  despite its typical whiteness  most note    people mentally picture the sun as yellow  the reasons for this are the subject of debate      the sun is a g v star  with g  indicating its surface temperature of approximately       k         c         f   and v that it  like most stars  is a main sequence star          the average luminance of the sun is about      giga candela per square metre  but as viewed through earth s atmosphere  this is lowered to about      gcd m   e  however  the luminance is not constant across the disk of the sun  limb darkening    composition  false color wiggle animation of the sun  normally the sun does not make gamma rays  but a flare on june          caused this gamma ray observation by the comptel instrument on the compton gamma ray observatory  neutrons from the sun collided with the intrastellar medium to produce gamma rays        solar flare as recorded by skylab see also  molecules in stars the sun is composed primarily of the chemical elements hydrogen and helium  at this time in the sun s life  they account for       and       of the mass of the sun in the photosphere  respectively      all heavier elements  called metals in astronomy  account for less than    of the mass  with oxygen  roughly    of the sun s mass   carbon         neon         and iron        being the most abundant       the sun s original chemical composition was inherited from the interstellar medium out of which it formed  originally it would have contained about       hydrogen        helium  and      heavier elements      the hydrogen and most of the helium in the sun would have been produced by big bang nucleosynthesis in the first    minutes of the universe  and the heavier elements were produced by previous generations of stars before the sun was formed  and spread into the interstellar medium during the final stages of stellar life and by events such as supernovae       since the sun formed  the main fusion process has involved fusing hydrogen into helium  over the past     billion years  the amount of helium and its location within the sun has gradually changed  within the core  the proportion of helium has increased from about     to about     due to fusion  and some of the helium and heavy elements have settled from the photosphere towards the center of the sun because of gravity  the proportions of metals  heavier elements  is unchanged  heat is transferred outward from the sun s core by radiation rather than by convection  see radiative zone below   so the fusion products are not lifted outward by heat  they remain in the core     and gradually an inner core of helium has begun to form that cannot be fused because presently the sun s core is not hot or dense enough to fuse helium  in the current photosphere the helium fraction is reduced  and the metallicity is only     of what it was in the protostellar phase  before nuclear fusion in the core started   in the future  helium will continue to accumulate in the core  and in about   billion years this gradual build up will eventually cause the sun to exit the main sequence and become a red giant       the chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial solar system      the solar heavy element abundances described above are typically measured both using spectroscopy of the sun s photosphere and by measuring abundances in meteorites that have never been heated to melting temperatures  these meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the protostellar sun and are thus not affected by settling of heavy elements  the two methods generally agree well       singly ionized iron group elements in the     s  much research focused on the abundances of iron group elements in the sun          although significant research was done  until      it was difficult to determine the abundances of some iron group elements  e g  cobalt and manganese  via spectrography because of their hyperfine structures       the first largely complete set of oscillator strengths of singly ionized iron group elements were made available in the     s      and these were subsequently improved      in       the abundances of singly ionized elements of the iron group were derived       isotopic composition various authors have considered the existence of a gradient in the isotopic compositions of solar and planetary noble gases      e g  correlations between isotopic compositions of neon and xenon in the sun and on the planets       prior to       it was thought that the whole sun has the same composition as the solar atmosphere      in       it was claimed that it was fractionation in the sun itself that caused the

of the sun s radius  where temperature  energies  and pressure are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur  hydrogen fuses into helium  which cannot currently be fused at this point in the sun s life   the fusion process releases energy  and the core gradually becomes enriched in helium  radiative zone   convection cannot occur until much nearer the surface of the sun  therefore  between about        of the radius  and     of the radius  there is a  radiative zone  in which energy transfer occurs by means of radiation  photons  rather than by convection  tachocline   the boundary region between the radiative and convective zones  convective zone   between about     of the sun s radius and a point close to the visible surface  the sun is cool and diffuse enough for convection to occur  and this becomes the primary means of outward heat transfer  similar to weather cells which form in the earth s atmosphere  photosphere   the deepest part of the sun which we can directly observe with visible light  because the sun is a gaseous object  it does not have a clearly defined surface  its visible parts are usually divided into a  photosphere  and  atmosphere   atmosphere   a gaseous  halo  surrounding the sun  comprising the chromosphere  solar transition region  corona and heliosphere  these can be seen when the main part of the sun is hidden  for example  during a solar eclipse  core main article  solar core the core of the sun extends from the center to about        of the solar radius      it has a density of up to     g cm           about     times the density of water  and a temperature of close to      million kelvin  k       by contrast  the sun s surface temperature is approximately      k  recent analysis of soho mission data favors a faster rotation rate in the core than in the radiative zone above      through most of the sun s life  energy has been produced by nuclear fusion in the core region through a series of nuclear reactions called the p p  proton proton  chain  this process converts hydrogen into helium      only      of the energy generated in the sun comes from another sequence of fusion reactions called the cno cycle  though this proportion is expected to increase as the sun becomes older           the core is the only region in the sun that produces an appreciable amount of thermal energy through fusion      of the power is generated within     of the sun s radius  and by     of the radius  fusion has stopped nearly entirely  the remainder of the sun is heated by this energy as it is transferred outwards through many successive layers  finally to the solar photosphere where it escapes into space through radiation  photons  or advection  massive particles            the proton proton chain occurs around          times each second in the core  converting about          protons into alpha particles  helium nuclei  every second  out of a total of           free protons in the sun   or about          kg s      fusing four free protons  hydrogen nuclei  into a single alpha particle  helium nucleus  releases around      of the fused mass as energy      so the sun releases energy at the mass energy conversion rate of      million metric tons per second  which requires     metric megatons of hydrogen        for       yottawatts             w      or            megatons of tnt per second  the large power output of the sun is mainly due to the huge size and density of its core  compared to earth and objects on earth   with only a fairly small amount of power being generated per cubic metre  theoretical models of the sun s interior indicate a maximum power density  or energy production  of approximately       watts per cubic metre at the center of the core      which is about the same power density as in body of a reptile or inside a compost pile      f   the fusion rate in the core is in a self correcting equilibrium  a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and expand slightly against the weight of the outer layers  reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation  and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly  increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate           radiative zone main article  radiative zone from the core out to about     solar radii  thermal radiation is the primary means of energy transfer      the temperature drops from approximately   million to   million kelvins with increasing distance from the core      this temperature gradient is less than the value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection  which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection      ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons  which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions      the density drops a hundredfold  from    g cm  to     g cm   from      solar radii to the     radii  the top of the radiative zone       tachocline main article  tachocline the radiative zone and the convective zone are separated by a transition layer  the tachocline  this is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear between the two a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another      presently  it is hypothesized  see solar dynamo  that a magnetic dynamo within this layer generates the sun s magnetic field       convective zone main article  convection zone the sun s convection zone extends from     solar radii          km  to near the surface  in this layer  the solar plasma is not dense enough or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation  instead  the density of the plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the sun s energy outward towards its surface  material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands  thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise  as a result  an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry the majority of the heat outward to the sun s photosphere above  once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface  its density increases  and it sinks to the base of the convection zone  where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues  at the photosphere  the temperature has dropped to       k and the density to only     g m   about         the density of air at sea level        the thermal columns of the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the sun giving it a granular appearance called the solar granulation at the smallest scale and supergranulation at larger scales  turbulent convection in this outer part of the solar interior sustains  small scale  dynamo action over the near surface volume of the sun      the sun s thermal columns are b nard cells and take the shape of roughly hexagonal prisms       photosphere  the effective temperature  or black body temperature  of the sun       k  is the temperature a black body of the same size must have to yield the same total emissive power  main article  photosphere a miasma of plasma high resolution image of the sun s surface taken by the daniel k  inouye solar telescope  dkist  the visible surface of the sun  the photosphere  is the layer below which the sun becomes opaque to visible light      photons produced in this layer escape the sun through the transparent solar atmosphere above it and become solar radiation  sunlight  the change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of h  ions  which absorb visible light easily      conversely  the visible light we see is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce h  ions          the photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick  and is slightly less opaque than air on earth  because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than the lower part  an image of the sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or limb of the solar disk  in a phenomenon known as limb darkening      the spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a black body radiating at      k  interspersed with atomic absorption lines from the tenuous layers above the photosphere  the photosphere has a particle density of       m    about       of the particle number per volume of earth s atmosphere at sea level   the photosphere is not fully ionized the extent of ionization is about     leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form       during early studies of the optical spectrum of the photosphere  some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any chemical elements then known on earth  in       norman lockyer hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed helium  after the greek sun god helios  twenty five years later  helium was isolated on earth       atmosphere see also  solar corona and coronal loop  during a total solar eclipse  the solar corona can be seen with the naked eye  during the brief period of totality  during a total solar eclipse  when the disk of the sun is covered by that of the moon  parts of the sun s surrounding atmosphere can be seen  it is composed of four distinct parts  the chromosphere  the transition region  the corona and the heliosphere   the coolest layer of the sun is a temperature minimum region extending to about     km above the photosphere  and has a temperature of about       k      this part of the sun is cool enough to allow the existence of simple molecules such as carbon monoxide and water  which can be detected via their absorption spectra       the chromosphere  transition region  and corona are much hotter than the surface of the sun      the reason is not well understood  but evidence suggests that alfv n waves may have enough energy to heat the corona       above the temperature minimum layer is a layer about       km thick  dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines      it is called the chromosphere from the greek root chroma  meaning color  because the chromosphere is visible as a colored flash at the beginning and end of total solar eclipses      the temperature of the chromosphere increases gradually with altitude  ranging up to around        k near the top      in the upper part of the chromosphere helium becomes partially ionized        taken by hinode s solar optical telescope on    january       this image of the sun reveals the filamentary nature of the plasma connecting regions of different magnetic polarity  above the chromosphere  in a thin  about     km  transition region  the temperature rises rapidly from around       k in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to         k      the temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region  which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma      the transition region does not occur at a well defined altitude  rather  it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments  and is in constant  chaotic motion      the transition region is not easily visible from earth s surface  but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum       the corona is the next layer of the sun  the low corona  near the surface of the sun  has a particle density around      m   to      m        g  the average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about                     k  however  in the hottest regions it is                      k      although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona  at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection          the corona is the extended atmosphere of the sun  which has a volume much larger than the volume enclosed by the sun s photosphere  a flow of plasma outward from the sun into interplanetary space is the solar wind       the heliosphere  the tenuous outermost atmosphere of the sun  is filled with the solar wind plasma  this outermost layer of the sun is defined to begin at the distance where the flow of the solar wind becomes superalfv nic that is  where the flow becomes faster than the speed of alfv n waves      at approximately    solar radii      au   turbulence and dynamic forces in the heliosphere cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within  because the information can only travel at the speed of alfv n waves  the solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere          forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape      until it impacts the heliopause more than    au from the sun  in december       the voyager   probe passed through a shock front that is thought to be part of the heliopause      in late      voyager   recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind  which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium       photons and neutrinos see also  solar irradiance high energy gamma ray photons initially released with fusion reactions in the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone  usually after traveling only a few millimeters  re emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy  with this sequence of emissions and absorptions  it takes a long time for radiation to reach the sun s surface  estimates of the photon travel time range between        and         years      in contrast  it takes only     seconds for the neutrinos  which account for about    of the total energy production of the sun  to reach the surface  because energy transport in the sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter  the time scale of energy transport in the sun is longer  on the order of            years  this is the time it would take the sun to return to a stable state  if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed        neutrinos are also released by the fusion reactions in the core  but  unlike photons  they rarely interact with matter  so almost all are able to escape the sun immediately  for many years measurements of the number of neutrinos produced in the sun were lower than theories predicted by a factor of    this discrepancy was resolved in      through the discovery of the effects of neutrino oscillation  the sun emits the number of neutrinos predicted by the theory  but neutrino detectors were missing      of them because the neutrinos had changed flavor by the time they were detected        magnetic activity magnetic field see also  stellar magnetic field  sunspots  list of solar cycles  and solar phenomena  visible light photograph of sunspot     december        butterfly diagram showing paired sunspot pattern  graph is of sunspot area   in this false color ultraviolet image  the sun shows a c  class solar flare  white area on upper left   a solar tsunami  wave like structure  upper right  and multiple filaments of plasma following a magnetic field  rising from the stellar surface   the heliospheric current sheet extends to the outer reaches of the solar system  and results from the influence of the sun s rotating magnetic field on the plasma in the interplanetary medium       the sun has a magnetic field that varies across the surface of the sun  its polar field is     gauss                t   whereas the field is typically       gauss      t  in features on the sun called sunspots and        gauss             t  in solar prominences      the magnetic field also varies in time and location  the quasi periodic    year solar cycle is the most prominent variation in which the number and size of sunspots waxes and wanes                  sunspots are visible as dark patches on the sun s photosphere  and correspond to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface  as a result  sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere  so they appear dark  at a typical solar minimum  few sunspots are visible  and occasionally none can be seen at all  those that do appear are at high solar latitudes  as the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum  sunspots tend to form closer to the solar equator  a phenomenon known as sp rer s law  the largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across        an    year sunspot cycle is half of a    year babcock leighton dynamo cycle  which corresponds to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields  at solar cycle maximum  the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo cycle minimum strength  but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field  generated through differential rotation within the tachocline  is near its maximum strength  at this point in the dynamo cycle  buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere  giving rise to pairs of sunspots  roughly aligned east west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities  the magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle  a phenomenon known as the hale cycle             during the solar cycle s declining phase  energy shifts from the internal toroidal magnetic field to the external poloidal field  and sunspots diminish in number and size  at solar cycle minimum  the toroidal field is  correspondingly  at minimum strength  sunspots are relatively rare  and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength  with the rise of the next    year sunspot cycle  differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field  but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle  the process carries on continuously  and in an idealized  simplified scenario  each    year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change  then  in the overall polarity of the sun s large scale magnetic field             the solar magnetic field extends well beyond the sun itself  the electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the sun s magnetic field into space  forming what is called the interplanetary magnetic field      in an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics  plasma particles only move along the magnetic field lines  as a result  the outward flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward  forcing it into a roughly radial structure  for a simple dipolar solar magnetic field  with opposite hemispherical polarities on either side of the solar magnetic equator  a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind      at great distances  the rotation of the sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an archimedean spiral structure called the parker spiral      the interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field  the sun s dipole magnetic field of         t  at the photosphere  reduces with the inverse cube of the distance  leading to a predicted magnetic field of     nt at the distance of earth  however  according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at earth s location is around   nt  about a hundred times greater       the difference is due to magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the sun   variation in activity  measurements from      of solar cycle variation during the last    years the sun s magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity  solar flares and coronal mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups  slowly changing high speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface  both coronal mass ejections and high speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and interplanetary magnetic field outward into the solar system       the effects of solar activity on earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and the disruption of radio communications and electric power  solar activity is thought to have played a large role in the formation and evolution of the solar system   with solar cycle modulation of sunspot number comes a corresponding modulation of space weather conditions  including those surrounding earth where technological systems can be affected   in december       a new type of solar magnetic explosion was observed  known as forced magnetic reconnection  previously  in a process called spontaneous magnetic reconnection  it was observed that the solar magnetic field lines diverge explosively and then converge again instantaneously  forced magnetic reconnection was similar  but it was triggered by an explosion in the corona        long term change long term secular change in sunspot number is thought  by some scientists  to be correlated with long term change in solar irradiance       which  in turn  might influence earth s long term climate       for example  in the   th century  the solar cycle appeared to have stopped entirely for several decades  few sunspots were observed during a period known as the maunder minimum  this coincided in time with the era of the little ice age  when europe experienced unusually cold temperatures       earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower than average global temperatures        a recent theory claims that there are magnetic instabilities in the core of the sun that cause fluctuations with periods of either        or         years  these could provide a better explanation of the ice ages than the milankovitch cycles             life phases main articles  formation and evolution of the solar system and stellar evolution the sun today is roughly halfway through the most stable part of its life  it has not changed dramatically for over four billion a  years  and will remain fairly stable for more than five billion more  however  after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped  the sun will undergo dramatic changes  both internally and externally   formation the sun formed about     billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars       this age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology      the result is consistent with the radiometric date of the oldest solar system material  at       billion years ago            studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short lived isotopes  such as iron     that form only in exploding  short lived stars  this indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the sun formed  a shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity       as one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate due to conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure  much of the mass became concentrated in the center  whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other solar system bodies  gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accreted more matter from the surrounding disk  eventually triggering nuclear fusion   hd        and hd        are hypothesized stellar siblings of the sun  having formed in the same molecular cloud   main sequence  evolution of the sun s luminosity  radius and effective temperature compared to the present sun  after ribas             the sun is about halfway through its main sequence stage  during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium  each second  more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the sun s core  producing neutrinos and solar radiation  at this rate  the sun has so far converted around     times the mass of earth into energy  about       of the total mass of the sun  the sun will spend a total of approximately    billion years as a main sequence star       the sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence  because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused  the core is therefore shrinking  allowing the outer layers of the sun to move closer to the center and experience a stronger gravitational force  according to the inverse square law  this stronger force increases the pressure on the core  which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs  this process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser  it is estimated that the sun has become     brighter in the last     billion years       at present  it is increasing in brightness by about    every     million years        after core hydrogen exhaustion  the size of the current sun  now in the main sequence  compared to its estimated size during its red giant phase in the future the sun does not have enough mass to explode as a supernova  instead it will exit the main sequence in approximately   billion years and start to turn into a red giant            as a red giant  the sun will grow so large that it will engulf mercury  venus  and probably earth             even before it becomes a red giant  the luminosity of the sun will have nearly doubled  and earth will receive as much sunlight as venus receives today  once the core hydrogen is exhausted in     billion years  the sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half a billion years  it will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today and a couple of thousand times more luminous  this then starts the red giant branch phase where the sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass         evolution of a sun like star  the track of a one solar mass star on the hertzsprung russell diagram is shown from the main sequence to the post asymptotic giant branch stage  after the red giant branch the sun has approximately     million years of active life left  but much happens  first  the core  full of degenerate helium ignites violently in the helium flash  where it is estimated that    of the core  itself     of the sun s mass  will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple alpha process       the sun then shrinks to around    times its current size and    times the luminosity  with a temperature a little lower than today  it will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch  but a star of the sun s mass does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch  instead  it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about     million years as it continues to react helium in the core        when the helium is exhausted  the sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted  except that this time it all happens faster  and the sun becomes larger and more luminous  this is the asymptotic giant branch phase  and the sun is alternately reacting hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell  after about    million years on the early asymptotic giant branch  the sun becomes increasingly unstable  with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every         years or so  the thermal pulses become larger each time  with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as       times the current level and the radius to over   au       according to a      model  earth s orbit is shrinking due to tidal forces  and  eventually  drag from the lower chromosphere   so that it will be engulfed by the sun near the tip of the red giant branch phase      and   million years after mercury and venus have respectively had the same fate  models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss  models that have higher mass loss on the red giant branch produce smaller  less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch  perhaps only       times the luminosity and less than     times the radius       for the sun  four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula  by the end of that phase lasting approximately         years the sun will only have about half of its current mass   the post asymptotic giant branch evolution is even faster  the luminosity stays approximately constant as the temperature increases  with the ejected half of the sun s mass becoming ionized into a planetary nebula as the exposed core reaches        k  the final naked core  a white dwarf  will have a temperature of over         k  and contain an estimated        of the sun s present day mass       the planetary nebula will disperse in about        years  but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical black dwarf             motion and location  illustration of the milky way  showing the

galactic center                                 the sun is contained within the local bubble  a space of rarefied hot gas  possibly produced by the supernova remnant geminga       or multiple supernovae in subgroup b  of the pleiades moving group       the distance between the local arm and the next arm out  the perseus arm  is about       light years       the sun  and thus the solar system  is found in what scientists call the galactic habitable zone  the apex of the sun s way  or the solar apex  is the direction that the sun travels relative to other nearby stars  this motion is towards a point in the constellation hercules  near the star vega   within      ly of the sun there are     known stars in     systems  as of       including     single stars  it is estimated that a further     systems within this range have not yet been identified  out to      ly  there may be up to       stars  of which around       are known  the number of substellar objects in that volume are

around the milky way is perturbed due to the non uniform mass distribution in milky way  such as that in and between the galactic spiral arms  it has been argued that the sun s passage through the higher density spiral arms often coincides with mass extinctions on earth  perhaps due to increased impact events       it takes the solar system about         million years to complete one orbit through the milky way  a galactic year        so it is thought to have completed       orbits during the lifetime of the sun  the orbital speed of the solar system about the center of the milky way is approximately     km s      mi s        at this speed  it takes around       years for the solar system to travel a distance of   light year  or   days to travel   au        the milky way is moving with respect to the cosmic microwave background radiation  cmb  in the direction of the constellation hydra with a speed of     km s  and the sun s resultant velocity with respect to the cmb is about     km s in the direction of crater or leo        motion in the solar system  apparent motion of the solar system barycentre with respect to the sun   it is actually the sun that moves  the sun is moved by the gravitational pull of the planets  one can think of the barycentre of the solar system as being stationary  or as moving in a steady motion around the galaxy   the centre of the sun is always within     solar radii of the barycentre  this motion of the sun is mainly due to jupiter  saturn  uranus  and neptune  for some periods of several decades  the motion is rather regular  forming a trefoil pattern  whereas between these periods it appears more chaotic       after     years  nine times the synodic period of jupiter and saturn  the pattern more or less repeats  but rotated by about           the orbits of the inner planets  including of the earth  are similarly displaced by the same graviational forces  so the movement of the sun has little effect on the relative positions of the earth and the sun or on solar irradiance on the earth as a function of time        theoretical problems  map of the full sun by stereo and sdo spacecraft coronal heating problem main article  stellar corona the temperature of the photosphere is approximately       k  whereas the temperature of the corona reaches                 k      the high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat conduction from the photosphere       it is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere  and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating      the first is wave heating  in which sound  gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone      these waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona  depositing their energy in the ambient matter in the form of heat       the other is magnetic heating  in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events nanoflares        currently  it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism  all waves except alfv n waves have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona       in addition  alfv n waves do not easily dissipate in the corona  current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms       faint young sun problem main article  faint young sun paradox theoretical models of the sun s development suggest that     to     billion years ago  during the archean eon  the sun was only about     as bright as it is today  such a weak star would not have been able to sustain liquid water on earth s surface  and thus life should not have been able to develop  however  the geological record demonstrates that earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history  and that the young earth was somewhat warmer than it is today  one theory among scientists is that the atmosphere of the young earth contained much larger quantities of greenhouse gases  such as carbon dioxide  methane  than are present today  which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of solar energy reaching it        however  examination of archaean sediments appears inconsistent with the hypothesis of high greenhouse concentrations  instead  the moderate temperature range may be explained by a lower surface albedo brought about by less continental area and the lack of biologically induced cloud condensation nuclei  this would have led to increased absorption of solar energy  thereby compensating for the lower solar output        observational history the enormous effect of the sun on earth has been recognized since prehistoric times  and the sun has been regarded by some cultures as a solar deity   early understanding  the trundholm sun chariot pulled by a horse is a sculpture believed to be illustrating an important part of nordic bronze age mythology  the sculpture is probably c       bc  it is displayed at the national museum of denmark  see also  the sun in culture the sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures throughout human history  humanity s most fundamental understanding of the sun is as the luminous disk in the sky  whose presence above the horizon creates day and whose absence causes night  in many prehistoric and ancient cultures  the sun was thought to be a solar deity or other supernatural entity  worship of the sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient egyptians  the inca of south america and the aztecs of what is now mexico  in religions such as hinduism  the sun is still considered a god  many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind  for example  stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice  some of the most prominent megaliths are located in nabta playa  egypt  mnajdra  malta and at stonehenge  england   newgrange  a prehistoric human built mount in ireland  was designed to detect the winter solstice  the pyramid of el castillo at chich n itz  in mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes   the egyptians portrayed the god ra as being carried across the sky in a solar barque  accompanied by lesser gods  and to the greeks  he was helios  carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses  from the reign of elagabalus in the late roman empire the sun s birthday was a holiday celebrated as sol invictus  literally  unconquered sun   soon after the winter solstice  which may have been an antecedent to christmas  regarding the fixed stars  the sun appears from earth to revolve once a year along the ecliptic through the zodiac  and so greek astronomers categorized it as one of the seven planets  greek planetes   wanderer    the naming of the days of the weeks after the seven planets dates to the roman era                  development of scientific understanding in the early first millennium bc  babylonian astronomers observed that the sun s motion along the ecliptic is not uniform  though they did not know why  it is today known that this is due to the movement of earth in an elliptic orbit around the sun  with earth moving faster when it is nearer to the sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion        one of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the sun was the greek philosopher anaxagoras  he reasoned that it was not the chariot of helios  but instead a giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the land of the peloponnesus and that the moon reflected the light of the sun       for teaching this heresy  he was imprisoned by the authorities and sentenced to death  though he was later released through the intervention of pericles  eratosthenes estimated the distance between earth and the sun in the  rd century bc as  of stadia myriads     and         the translation of which is ambiguous  implying either           stadia          km  or             stadia      to     million kilometers or      to      au   the latter value is correct to within a few percent  in the  st century ad  ptolemy estimated the distance as       times the radius of earth  approximately      million kilometers         au         the theory that the sun is the center around which the planets orbit was first proposed by the ancient greek aristarchus of samos in the  rd century bc  and later adopted by seleucus of seleucia  see heliocentrism   this view was developed in a more detailed mathematical model of a heliocentric system in the   th century by nicolaus copernicus   observations of sunspots were recorded during the han dynasty      bc ad      by chinese astronomers  who maintained records of these observations for centuries  averroes also provided a description of sunspots in the   th century       the invention of the telescope in the early   th century permitted detailed observations of sunspots by thomas harriot  galileo galilei and other astronomers  galileo posited that sunspots were on the surface of the sun rather than small objects passing between earth and the sun        arabic astronomical contributions include al battani s discovery that the direction of the sun s apogee  the place in the sun s orbit against the fixed stars where it seems to be moving slowest  is changing        in modern heliocentric terms  this is caused by a gradual motion of the aphelion of the earth s orbit   ibn yunus observed more than        entries for the sun s position for many years using a large astrolabe         sol  the sun  from a      edition of guido bonatti s liber astronomiae  from an observation of a transit of venus in       the persian astronomer and polymath ibn sina concluded that venus is closer to earth than the sun       in      giovanni cassini and jean richer determined the distance to mars and were thereby able to calculate the distance to the sun   in       isaac newton observed the sun s light using a prism  and showed that it is made up of light of many colors       in       william herschel discovered infrared radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum       the   th century saw advancement in spectroscopic studies of the sun  joseph von fraunhofer recorded more than     absorption lines in the spectrum  the strongest of which are still often referred to as fraunhofer lines  in the early years of the modern scientific era  the source of the sun s energy was a significant puzzle  lord kelvin suggested that the sun is a gradually cooling liquid body that is radiating an internal store of heat       kelvin and hermann von helmholtz then proposed a gravitational contraction mechanism to explain the energy output  but the resulting age estimate was only    million years  well short of the time span of at least     million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time            in      joseph lockyer  who discovered helium in the solar spectrum  proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the sun        not until      was a documented solution offered  ernest rutherford suggested that the sun s output could be maintained by an internal source of heat  and suggested radioactive decay as the source       however  it would be albert einstein who would provide the essential clue to the source of the sun s energy output with his mass energy equivalence relation e   mc        in       sir arthur eddington proposed that the pressures and temperatures at the core of the sun could produce a nuclear fusion reaction that merged hydrogen  protons  into helium nuclei  resulting in a production of energy from the net change in mass       the preponderance of hydrogen in the sun was confirmed in      by cecilia payne using the ionization theory developed by meghnad saha  the theoretical concept of fusion was developed in the     s by the astrophysicists subrahmanyan chandrasekhar and hans bethe  hans bethe calculated the details of the two main energy producing nuclear reactions that power the sun            in       margaret burbidge  geoffrey burbidge  william fowler and fred hoyle showed

october            it has proven so useful that a follow on mission  the solar dynamics observatory  sdo   was launched in february            situated at the lagrangian point between earth and the sun  at which the gravitational pull from both is equal   soho has provided a constant view of the sun at many wavelengths since its launch      besides its direct solar observation  soho has enabled the discovery of a large number of comets  mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the sun         a solar prominence erupts in august       as captured by sdo all these satellites have observed the sun from the plane of the ecliptic  and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail  the ulysses probe was launched in      to study the sun s polar regions  it first traveled to jupiter  to  slingshot  into an orbit that would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic  once ulysses was in its scheduled orbit  it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes  finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about     km s  which was slower than expected  and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes that scattered galactic cosmic rays        elemental abundances in the photosphere are well known from spectroscopic studies  but the composition of the interior of the sun is more

atmospheric conditions  the sun becomes visible to the naked eye  and can be observed without stress to the eyes  click on this photo to see the full cycle of a sunset  as observed from the high plains of the mojave desert   the sun  as seen from low earth orbit overlooking the international space station  this sunlight is not filtered by the lower atmosphere  which blocks much of the solar spectrum  the brightness of the sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye  however  doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non dilated eyes            looking directly at the sun causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness  it also delivers about   milliwatts of sunlight to the retina  slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness            uv exposure gradually yellows the lens of the eye over a period of years  and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts  but this depends on general exposure to solar uv  and not whether one looks directly at the sun       long duration viewing of the direct sun with the naked eye can begin to cause uv induced  sunburn like lesions on the retina after about     seconds  particularly under conditions where the uv light from the sun is intense and well focused            conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants  which admit more uv than aging natural eyes   sun angles near the zenith  and observing locations at high altitude   viewing the sun through light concentrating optics such as binoculars may result in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter that blocks uv and substantially dims the sunlight  when using an attenuating filter to view the sun  the viewer is cautioned to use a filter specifically designed for that use  some improvised filters that pass uv or ir rays  can actually harm the eye at high brightness levels       herschel wedges  also called solar diagonals  are effective and inexpensive for small telescopes  the sunlight that is destined for the eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface of a piece of glass  only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected  the rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument  if the glass breaks because of the heat  no light at all is reflected  making the device fail safe  simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break  endangering the observer s eyesight  unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye  possibly causing immediate damage  it is claimed that even brief glances at the midday sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage         halo with sun dogs partial solar eclipses are hazardous to view because the eye s pupil is not adapted to the unusually high visual contrast  the pupil dilates according to the total amount of light in the field of view  not by the brightest object in the field  during partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the moon passing in front of the sun  but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same surface brightness as during a normal day  in the overall gloom  the pupil expands from    mm to    mm  and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives up to ten times more light than it would looking at the non eclipsed sun  this can damage or kill those cells  resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer       the hazard is insidious for inexperienced observers and for children  because there is no perception of pain  it is not immediately obvious that one s vision is being destroyed    a sunrise  a sunset in thailand in summer during sunrise and sunset  sunlight is attenuated because of rayleigh scattering and mie scattering from a particularly long passage through earth s atmosphere       and the sun is sometimes faint enough to be viewed comfortably with the naked eye or safely with optics  provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds   hazy conditions  atmospheric dust  and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation        an optical phenomenon  known as a green flash  can sometimes be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise  the flash is caused by light from the sun just below the horizon being bent  usually through a temperature inversion  towards the observer  light of shorter wavelengths  violet  blue  green  is bent more than that of longer wavelengths  yellow  orange  red  but the violet and blue light is scattered more  leaving light that is perceived as green        ultraviolet light from the sun has antiseptic properties and can be used to sanitize tools and water  it also causes sunburn  and has other biological effects such as the production of vitamin d and sun tanning  it is also the main cause of skin cancer  ultraviolet light is strongly attenuated by earth s ozone layer  so that the amount of uv varies greatly with latitude and has been partially responsible for many biological adaptations  including variations in human skin color in different regions of the earth        planetary system main article  solar system  size comparison of the sun and its planets  clickable  the sun has eight known planets  this includes four terrestrial planets

ancient sumerians believed that the sun was utu            the god of justice and twin brother of inanna  the queen of heaven       who was identified as the planet venus       later  utu was identified with the east semitic god shamash            utu was regarded as a helper deity  who aided those in distress       and  in iconography  he is usually portrayed with a long beard and clutching a saw       which represented his role as the dispenser of justice        from at least the fourth dynasty of ancient egypt  the sun was worshipped as the god ra  portrayed as a falcon headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk  and surrounded by a serpent  in the new empire period  the sun became identified with the dung beetle  whose spherical ball of dung was identified with

later times  helios was syncretized with apollo        in the bible  malachi     mentions the  sun of righteousness   sometimes translated as the  sun of justice         which some christians have interpreted as a reference to the messiah  christ        in ancient roman culture  sunday was the day of the sun god  it was adopted as the sabbath day by christians who did not have a jewish background  the symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by christians  and perhaps the most important one that did not come from jewish traditions  in paganism  the sun was a source of life  giving

bullock carts      modern space research in india is traced to the     s  when scientist s  k  mitra conducted a series of experiments leading to the sounding of the ionosphere by applying ground based radio methods in kolkata      later  indian scientists like c v  raman and meghnad saha contributed to scientific principles applicable in space sciences      however  it was the period after      that saw important developments being made in coordinated space research in india      organised space research in india was spearheaded by two scientists  vikram sarabhai founder of the physical research laboratory at ahmedabad and homi bhabha  who established the tata institute of fundamental research in           engineers were drawn from the indian ordnance factories on deputation to harness their knowledge of propellants and advanced metallurgy as the ordnance factories were the only organisation specialising in these technologies at that time  citation needed  initial experiments in space sciences included the study of cosmic radiation  high altitude and airborne testing  deep underground experimentation at the kolar mines one of the deepest mining sites in the world and studies of the upper atmosphere      studies were carried out at research laboratories  universities  and independent locations           in       the department of atomic energy was founded with bhabha as its secretary      the department provided funding for space research throughout india      during this time  tests continued on aspects of meteorology and the earth s magnetic field  a topic that was being studied in india since the establishment of the observatory at colaba in       in       the uttar pradesh state observatory was established at the foothills of the himalayas      the rangpur observatory was set up in      at osmania university  hyderabad  space research was further encouraged by the government of india      in       the soviet union launched sputnik   and opened up possibilities for the rest of the world to conduct a space launch       the indian national committee for space research  incospar  was set up in           goals and objectives  vikram sarabhai  first chairperson of incospar  which would later be called isro the prime objective of isro is to use space technology and its application to various national tasks      the indian space programme was driven by the vision of vikram sarabhai  considered the father of the indian space programme          as he said in        there are some who question the relevance of space activities in a developing nation  to us  there is no ambiguity of purpose  we do not have the fantasy of competing with the economically advanced nations in the exploration of the moon or the planets or manned space flight  but we are convinced that if we are to play a meaningful role nationally  and in the community of nations  we must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to the real problems of man and society  which we find in our country  and we should note that the application of sophisticated technologies and methods of analysis to our problems is not to be confused with embarking on grandiose schemes  whose primary impact is for show rather than for progress measured in hard economic and social terms     vikram sarabhai       former president of india  a  p  j  abdul kalam  said   very many individuals with myopic vision questioned the relevance of space activities in a newly independent nation which was finding it difficult to feed its population  but neither prime minister nehru nor prof  sarabhai had any ambiguity of purpose  their vision was very clear  if indians were to play a meaningful role in the community of nations  they must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to their real life problems  they had no intention of using it merely as a means of displaying our might     a  p  j  abdul kalam       india s economic progress has made its space programme more visible and active as the country aims for greater self reliance in space technology      in       india launched as many as eleven satellites  including nine foreign and went on to become the first nation to launch ten satellites on one rocket      isro has put into operation two major satellite systems  the indian national satellites  insat  for communication services  and the indian remote sensing programme  irs  satellites for management of natural resources   in july       abdul kalam said that research was being done by isro and drdo for

controversies s band spectrum scam in india  electromagnetic spectrum  being a scarce resource for wireless communication  is auctioned by the government of india to telecom companies for use  as an example of its value  in          mhz of  g spectrum was auctioned for      billion  us     billion   this part of the spectrum is allocated for terrestrial communication  cell phones   however  in january       antrix corporation  commercial arm of isro  signed an agreement with devas multimedia  a private company formed by former isro employees and venture capitalists from the us  for lease of s band transponders  amounting to    mhz of spectrum  on two isro satellites  gsat   and gsat  a  for a price of     billion  us     million   to be paid over a period of    years  the spectrum used in these satellites       mhz and above  is allocated by the international telecommunication union specifically for satellite based communication in india  hypothetically  if the spectrum allocation is changed for utilisation for terrestrial transmission and if this    mhz of spectrum were sold at the      auction price of the  g spectrum  its value would have been over        billion  us    billion   this was a hypothetical situation  however  the comptroller and auditor general of india considered this hypothetical situation and estimated the difference between the prices as a loss to the indian government             there were lapses on implementing government of india procedures  antrix isro had allocated the capacity of the above two satellites to devas multimedia on an exclusive basis  while rules said it should always be non exclusive  the cabinet was misinformed in november      that several service providers were interested in using satellite capacity  while the devas deal was already signed  also  the space commission was kept in the dark while taking approval for the second satellite  its cost was diluted so that cabinet approval was not needed   isro committed to spending       billion  us     million  of public money on building  launching  and operating two satellites that were leased out for devas   in late       some isro insiders exposed information about the devas antrix deal            and the ensuing investigations resulted in the deal being annulled  g  madhavan nair  isro chairperson when the agreement was signed  was barred from holding any post under the department of space  some former scientists were found guilty of  acts of commission  or  acts of omission   devas and deutsche telekom demanded us   billion and us   billion  respectively  in damages       government of india s department of revenue and ministry of corporate affairs initiated an inquiry into devas shareholding   the central bureau of investigation concluded investigations into the antrix devas scam and registered a case against the accused in the antrix devas deal under section     b  besides section     of ipc and section       read with       d  of pc act       on    march      against the then executive director of antrix corporation  two officials of usa based company  bangalore based private multimedia company  and other unknown officials of antrix corporation or department of space             devas multimedia started arbitration proceedings against antrix in june       in september       the international court of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce ruled in favour of devas  and directed antrix to pay us     million  rs       billion  in damages to devas       antrix opposed the devas plea for

domesticated carnivore of the family canidae  it is part of the wolf like canids     and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore                   the dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated              which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct      the dog was the first species to be domesticated          and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors  sensory capabilities  and physical attributes       their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior      and they can thrive on a starch rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids      dogs vary widely in shape  size  and colors      they perform many roles for humans  such as hunting  herding  pulling loads  protection  assisting police and military  companionship  and  more recently  aiding disabled people  and therapeutic roles  this influence

zoologist carl linnaeus published in his systema naturae the binomial nomenclature   or the two word naming   of species  canis is the latin word meaning  dog       and under this genus  he listed the dog like carnivores  including domestic dogs  wolves  and jackals  he classified the domestic dog as canis familiaris  and on the next page  he classified the wolf as canis lupus     linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its cauda recurvata   its upturning tail  which is not found in any other canid       in       a study of mitochondrial dna indicated that the domestic dog might have originated from multiple grey wolf populations  with the dingo and new guinea singing dog  breeds  having developed at a time when human communities were more isolated from each other      in the third edition of mammal species of the world published in       the mammalogist w  christopher wozencraft listed under the wolf canis lupus its wild subspecies  and proposed two additional subspecies   familiaris linneaus        domestic dog   and  dingo meyer        domestic dog    wozencraft included hallstromi   the new guinea singing dog   as a taxonomic synonym for the dingo  wozencraft referred to the mdna study as one of the guides informing his decision     other mammalogists have noted the inclusion of familiaris and dingo under a  domestic dog  clade      this classification by wozencraft is debated among zoologists       in       a workshop hosted by the iucn species survival commission s canid specialist group considered the new guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dogs canis familiaris  and therefore should not be assessed for the iucn red list       origin main article  origin of the domestic dog the domestic dog s origin includes the dog s genetic divergence from the wolf  its domestication  and its development into dog types and dog breeds  the dog is a member of the genus canis  which forms part of the wolf like canids  and was the first species and the only large carnivore to have been domesticated          genetic studies comparing dogs with modern wolves show reciprocal monophyly  separate groups   which implies that dogs are not genetically close to any living wolf and that their wild ancestor is extinct          an extinct late pleistocene wolf may have been the dog s ancestor         with the dog s similarity to the extant grey wolf being the result of genetic admixture between the two     in       a literature review of canid domestication stated that modern dogs were not descended from the same canis lineage as modern wolves  and proposes that dogs may be descended from a pleistocene wolf closer in size to a village dog       the genetic divergence between dogs and wolves occurred between        and        years ago  just before or during the last glacial maximum                       years ago   this period represents the upper time limit for domestication commencement because it is the time of divergence and not the time of domestication  which occurred later          one of the most critical transitions in human history was the domestication of animals  which began with the long term association between wolves and hunter gatherers more than        years ago      the archaeological record and genetic analysis show the remains of the bonn oberkassel dog buried beside humans        years ago to be the first undisputed dog  with disputed remains occurring        years ago     by        years ago  there were five distinct dog lineages all sharing a common ancestry distinct from present day wolves       biology  lateral view of skeleton anatomy main article  dog anatomy  skull of a dog domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors  sensory capabilities  and physical attributes      modern dog breeds show more variation in size  appearance  and behavior than any other domestic animal      dogs are predators and scavengers  like many other predatory mammals  the dog has powerful muscles  large and sharp claws and teeth  fused wrist bones  a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance  and teeth for catching and tearing   size and weight dogs are highly variable in height and weight  the smallest known adult dog was a yorkshire terrier  that stood only     centimetres        inches  at the shoulder      cm        in  in length along the head and body  and weighed only     grams    ounces   the most massive known dog was a saint bernard  which weighed       kg          lb  and was     cm    ft   in  from the snout to the tail      the tallest dog is a great dane that stands       cm    ft   in  at the shoulder       senses further information  dog anatomy   senses the dog s senses include vision  hearing  smell  taste  touch and sensitivity to the earth s magnetic field  another study suggested that dogs can see the earth s magnetic field               coat main article  coat  dog   dogs display a wide variation on coat type  density  length  color  and composition the coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties   double  being familiar with dogs  as well as wolves  originating from colder climates  made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair  or  single   with the topcoat only  breeds may have an occasional  blaze   stripe  or  star  of white fur on their chest or underside       the coat can be maintained or affected by multiple nutrients present in the diet  see coat  dog  for more information   premature graying can occur in dogs from as early as one year of age  this is shown to be associated with impulsive behaviors  anxiety behaviors  fear of noise  and fear of unfamiliar people or animals       tail  finnish spitz with curled tail there are many different shapes for dog tails  straight  straight up  sickle  curled  or cork screw  as with many canids  one of the primary functions of a dog s tail is to communicate their emotional state  which can be crucial in getting along with others  in some hunting dogs  however  the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries      in some breeds  such as the braque du bourbonnais  puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all       differences from wolves despite their close genetic relationship and interbreedability  there are several diagnostic features to distinguish the gray wolves from domestic dogs  domesticated dogs are distinguishable from wolves by starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase      the tympanic bullae are large  convex  and almost spherical in gray wolves  while the bullae of dogs are smaller  compressed  and slightly crumpled      compared with equally sized wolves  dogs tend to have     smaller skulls and     smaller brains         the teeth of gray wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs      dogs have a more domed forehead and a distinctive  stop  between the forehead and nose      the temporalis muscle that closes the jaws is more robust in wolves         wolves do not have dewclaws on their back legs unless there has been admixture with dogs that had them      most dogs lack a functioning pre caudal gland and enter estrus twice yearly  unlike gray wolves  which only do so once a year      so called primitive dogs such as dingoes and basenjis retain the yearly estrus cycle       dogs generally have brown eyes  and wolves almost always have amber or light colored eyes      domestic dogs  skin tends to be thicker than that of wolves  with some inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather      the paws of a dog are half the size of a wolf  and their tails tend to curl upwards  another trait not found in wolves      the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal       health main article  dog health many household plants are poisonous to dogs  and other mammals   including begonia  poinsettia  and aloe vera       some breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia  blindness  deafness  pulmonic stenosis  cleft palate  and trick knees  two severe medical conditions significantly affecting dogs are pyometra  affecting unspayed females of all types and ages  and gastric dilatation volvulus  bloat   which affects the larger breeds or deep chested dogs  both of these are acute conditions and can kill rapidly  dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas  ticks  mites  hookworms  tapeworms  roundworms  and heartworms  roundworm species that lives in the heart of dogs    several human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs  including chocolate solids  theobromine poisoning   onion and garlic  thiosulphate  sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning       grapes and raisins  macadamia nuts  xylitol      as well as various plants and other potentially ingested materials          the nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous  dogs can be exposed to the substance by scavenging through garbage bins or ashtrays and eating cigars and cigarettes  signs can be vomiting of large amounts  e g   from eating cigar butts  or diarrhea  some other symptoms are abdominal pain  loss of coordination  collapse  or death      dogs are susceptible to theobromine poisoning  typically from the ingestion of chocolate  theobromine is toxic to dogs because  although the dog s metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical  the process is so slow that for some dogs  even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal  mostly dark chocolate   dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans  including diabetes  dental and heart disease  epilepsy  cancer  hypothyroidism  and arthritis       lifespan further information  aging in dogs  mixed breed dogs such as this terrier have been found to run faster and live longer than their pure bred parents  see heterosis   in       a study found that mixed breed dogs live on average     years longer than purebred dogs  increasing body weight was negatively correlated with longevity  i e   the heavier the dog  the shorter its lifespan        the typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds  but for most  the median longevity  the age at which half the dogs in a population have died  and half are still alive  ranges from    to    years                  individual dogs may live well beyond the median of their breed   the breed with the shortest lifespan  among breeds for which there is a questionnaire survey with reasonable sample size  is the dogue de bordeaux  with a median longevity of about     years  still  several breeds  including miniature bull terriers  bloodhounds  and irish wolfhounds are nearly as short lived  with median longevities of   to   years       the longest lived breeds  including toy poodles  japanese spitz  border terriers  and tibetan spaniels  have median longevities of    to    years      the median longevity of mixed breed dogs  taken as an average of all sizes  is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged                  the longest lived dog was  bluey   an australian cattle dog who died in      at      years of age           reproduction main article  canine reproduction  female dog nursing newborn puppies in domestic dogs  sexual maturity happens around six to twelve months of age for both males and females          although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds  and is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle  they will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually  during which the body prepares for pregnancy  at the peak of the cycle  females will become estrus  mentally  and physically receptive to copulation      because the ova survive and can be fertilized for a week after ovulation  more than one male can sire the same litter       fertilization typically occurs     days after ovulation        days after ovulation  the embryo attaches to the uterus  and after     more days  the heartbeat is detectable           dogs bear their litters roughly    to    days after fertilization          with an average of    days  although the length of gestation can vary  an average litter consists of about six puppies      though this number may vary widely based on dog breed  in general  toy dogs produce from one to four puppies in each litter  while much larger breeds may average as many as twelve   some dog breeds have acquired traits through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction  male french bulldogs  for instance  are incapable of mounting the female  for many dogs of this breed  the female must be artificially inseminated to reproduce       neutering  a feral dog from sri lanka nursing very well developed puppies neutering refers to the sterilization of animals  usually by removing the male s testicles or the female s ovaries and uterus  to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive  because of dogs  overpopulation in some countries  many animal control agencies  such as the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals  aspca   advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered  that way  they do not have undesired puppies that may later be euthanized       according to the humane society of the united states      million dogs and cats are euthanized each year  many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes  spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down      local humane societies  spcas  and other animal protection organizations urge people to neuter their pets and adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them   neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality  especially in male dogs      spayed female dogs are less likely to develop cancer  affecting mammary glands  ovaries  and other reproductive organs      however  neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in female dogs      and prostate cancer in males      and osteosarcoma  hemangiosarcoma  cruciate ligament rupture  obesity  and diabetes mellitus in either sex       inbreeding depression a common breeding practice for pet dogs is mating between close relatives  e g   between half  and full siblings       inbreeding depression is considered to be due mainly to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations      outcrossing between unrelated individuals  including dogs of different breeds  results in the beneficial masking of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny       in a study of seven breeds of dogs  bernese mountain dog  basset hound  cairn terrier  epagneul breton  german shepherd dog  leonberger  and west highland white terrier   it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival      another analysis of data on        dachshund litters found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased  litter size decreased  and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased  thus indicating inbreeding depression      in a study of boxer litters      of puppies died before reaching seven weeks of age      stillbirth was the most frequent cause of death  followed by infection  mortality due to infection increased significantly with increases in inbreeding       intelligence  behavior  and communication intelligence main article  dog intelligence dog intelligence is the dog s ability to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems  studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference and have advanced memory skills  a study with rico  a border collie  showed that he knew the labels of over     different items  he inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items immediately and four weeks after the initial exposure  a study of another border collie   chaser   documented his learning and memory capabilities  he had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over       words      dogs can read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing and human voice commands   a      study on canine cognitive abilities found that dogs  capabilities are no more exceptional than those of other animals  such as horses  chimpanzees  or cats      various animals  including pigs  pigeons  and chimpanzees  can remember the  what  where  and when  of an event  which dogs cannot do       dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception      an experimental study showed compelling evidence that australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non social problem solving  indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem solving abilities once they joined humans      another study revealed that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task  dogs faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human  while socialized wolves do not       behavior main article  dog behavior see also  dog behavior   behavior compared with other canids  a   year old border collie at showing companion for human dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses  actions or inactions  of the domestic dog  individuals or groups  to internal and external stimuli      as the oldest domesticated species  with estimates ranging from              years bce  dogs  minds inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans  as a result of this physical and social evolution  dogs have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans more than any other species  and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors      behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social cognitive abilities in the domestic dog  these abilities are not possessed by the dog s closest canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes but rather parallel to children s social cognitive skills       unlike other domestic species selected for production related traits  dogs were initially selected for their behaviors          in       a study found that only    fixed genes showed variation between wolves and dogs  these gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication  these genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway  with the majority of the genes affecting the fight or flight response          i e   selection for tameness   and emotional processing      dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared with wolves          some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds  indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and later in breed formation      traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to williams beuren syndrome in humans  which cause hyper sociability at the expense of problem solving ability                  communication main article  dog communication dog communication is how dogs convey information to other dogs  understand messages from humans  and translate the information that dogs are transmitting       xii communication behaviors of dogs include eye gaze  facial expression  vocalization  body posture  including movements of bodies and limbs   and gustatory communication  scents  pheromones  and taste   humans communicate to dogs by using vocalization  hand signals  and body posture   ecology population in       an estimated global dog population was between     million      and     million       although it is said that the  dog is man s best friend        this refers mainly to the      of dogs that live in developed countries  in the developing world  dogs are more commonly feral or communally owned  with pet dogs uncommon      most of these dogs live their lives as scavengers and have never been owned by humans  with one study showing their most common response when approached by strangers is to run away       or respond aggressively             little is known about these dogs  or the dogs in developed countries that are feral  stray  or are in shelters because the great majority of modern research on dog cognition has focused on pet dogs living in human homes        competitors and predators although dogs are the most abundant and widely distributed terrestrial carnivores  feral  and free ranging dogs  potential to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with humans     for example  a review of the studies in dogs  competitive effects on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves            although wolves are known to kill dogs  they tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted  giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groups             wolves kill dogs wherever they are found together       one study reported that in wisconsin  in       more compensation had been paid for losses due to wolves taking dogs than for wolves taking livestock  in wisconsin  wolves will often kill hunting dogs  possibly because they are in the wolf s territory       a strategy has been reported in russia where one wolf lures a dog into a heavy brush where another wolf waits in ambush       in some instances  wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs  to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed       although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low  it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs  and losses of dogs to wolves have led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations        coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs  in particular  leopards are known to have a preference for dogs and have been recorded to kill and consume them no matter their size       tigers in manchuria  indochina  indonesia  and malaysia are also reported to kill dogs       striped hyenas are known to kill dogs in turkmenistan  india  and the caucasus        diet see also  dog food  golden retriever gnawing on a pig s foot dogs have been described as carnivores           or omnivores                     compared to wolves  dogs from agricultural societies have extra copies of amylase and other genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch rich diet      also  like humans  some dog breeds produce amylase in their saliva  based on metabolism and nutrition  many consider the dog to be an omnivore        however  the dog is not merely an omnivore  more like the cat and less like other omnivores  the dog can only produce bile acid with taurine  and it cannot produce vitamin d  which it obtains from animal flesh  also  more like the cat  the dog requires arginine to maintain its nitrogen balance  these nutritional requirements place the dog part way between carnivores and omnivores        range as a domesticated or semi domesticated animal  the dog is nearly universal among human societies  notable exceptions once included   aboriginal tasmanians  who were separated from australia before the arrival of dingos on that continent the andamanese  who were isolated when rising sea levels covered the land bridge to myanmar the fuegians  who instead domesticated the fuegian dog  a different canid species individual pacific islands whose maritime settlers did not bring dogs  or where dogs died out after original settlement  notably  the mariana islands       palau       marshall islands       gilbert islands

the bounty mutineers  who killed off their dogs to escape discovery by passing ships        dogs were introduced to antarctica as sled dogs but were later outlawed by international agreement due to the possible risk of spreading infections        breeds main article  dog breed  different dog breeds show a range of phenotypic variation the domestic dog is the first species  and the only large carnivore  known to have been domesticated  especially over the past     years  dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and were formed into today s modern dog breeds due to artificial selection by humans  these breeds can vary in size and weight from a      kg    lb  teacup poodle to a    kg      lb  giant mastiff  phenotypic variation can include height measured to the withers ranging from      cm    in  in the chihuahua to    cm     in  in the irish wolfhound  color varies from white through grays  usually called  blue   to black  and browns from light  tan  to dark   red  or  chocolate

dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within carnivores  entire order  some breeds demonstrate outstanding skills in herding  retrieving  scent detection  and guarding  demonstrating the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs  the first dogs were domesticated from shared ancestors of modern wolves  however  the phenotypic changes that coincided with the dog wolf genetic divergence are unknown       further information  dog type roles with humans  gunnar kaasen and balto  the lead dog on the last relay team of the      serum run to nome domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors  such as bite inhibition  from their wolf ancestors  which would have been pack hunters with complex body language  these sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability  playfulness  and ability to fit into human households and social situations  these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species today       pages        the dogs  value to early human hunter gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures  dogs perform many roles for people  such as hunting  herding  pulling loads  protection  assisting police and military  companionship  and  more recently  aiding disabled individuals  this influence on human society has given them the nickname  man s best friend  in the western world  in some cultures  however  dogs are also a source of meat             early roles wolves  and their dog descendants  likely derived significant benefits from living in human camps   more safety  more reliable food  lesser caloric needs  and more chance to breed       they would have benefited from humans  upright gait that gives them a more extensive range over which to see potential predators and prey  and better color vision that  at least by day  gives humans better visual discrimination       camp dogs would also have benefited from human tool use  bringing down larger prey and controlling fire for various purposes        humans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps       for instance  dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps       dogs may have provided warmth  as referred to in the australian aboriginal expression  three dog night   a frigidly cold night   they would have alerted the camp to predators or strangers  using their acute hearing to provide an early warning        it has been suggested that the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs  robust sense of smell to assist with the hunt       the relationship between a dog s presence and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf  and a      study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting were an essential factor in wolf domestication        the cohabitation of dogs and humans likely improved the chances of survival for early human groups  the domestication of dogs may have been one of the key forces that led to human success        human emigrants from siberia that came across the bering land bridge into north america likely had dogs in their company  although one writer      even suggests that sled dogs  use may have been critical to the success of the waves that entered north america roughly        years ago       the earliest archaeological evidence of dog like canids in north america dates from about       years ago                dogs were an important part of life for the athabascan population in north america and were their only domesticated animal  dogs as pack animals may have contributed to the apache and navajo tribes  migration       years ago  this use of dogs in these cultures often persisted after the introduction of the horse to north america        as pets  green

become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other s lives       to the point where pet dogs actively shape how a family and home are experienced        there have been two significant trends occurring within the second half of the   th century in pet dogs  changing status  the first has been the  commodification   shaping it to conform to social expectations of personality and behavior       the second has been the broadening of the family s concept and the home to include dogs as dogs within everyday routines and practices        a vast range of commodity forms aims to transform a pet

issue in the last decades of the   th century  many normal dog behaviors such as barking  jumping up  digging  rolling in dung  fighting  and urine marking  which dogs do to establish territory through scent  became increasingly incompatible with a pet dog s new role       dog training books  classes  and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued        the majority of contemporary dog owners describe their pet as part of the family       although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog human family as a pack       some dog trainers  such as on the television program dog whisperer  have promoted a dominance model of dog human relationships  however  it has been disputed that  trying to achieve status  is characteristic of dog human interactions       pet dogs play an active role in family life  for example  a study of conversations in dog human families showed how family members use the dog as a resource  talking to the dog  or talking through the dog  to mediate their interactions with each other        increasingly  human family members engage in activities centered on the dog s perceived needs and interests  or in which the dog is an integral partner  such as dog dancing and dog yoga        according to statistics published by the american pet products manufacturers association in the national pet owner survey in            an estimated      million people in the united states have pet dogs       the same source shows that nearly     of american households own at least one dog  of which     own just one dog      two dogs and nearly    more than two dogs  there does not seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets  as the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and male dog pets  although several programs promote pet adoption  less than a fifth of the owned dogs come from shelters   some research suggests that a pet dog produces a considerable carbon footprint             a study using magnetic resonance imaging  mri  to compare humans and dogs showed that dogs have the same response to voices and use the same parts of the

the consumption of dog meat       following the sui and tang dynasties of the first millennium  however  people living on northern china s plains began to eschew eating dogs  which is likely due to buddhism and islam s spread  two religions that forbade the consumption of certain animals  including dog  as members of the upper classes shunned dog meat  it gradually became a social taboo to eat it  even though the general population continued to consume it for centuries afterward       other cultures  such as polynesia and pre columbian mexico  also consumed dog meat in their history

health problems during the first month following pet acquisition  this effect was sustained in those with dogs through to the end of the study        people with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats and those without pets  the results provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and behavior and that for guardians of dogs  these effects are relatively long term       pet guardianship has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival  human guardians are significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogs        the health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general  not solely from having dogs as pets  for example  when in a pet dog s presence  people show reductions in cardiovascular  behavioral  and psychological indicators of anxiety       other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune stimulating microorganisms  which can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases according to the hygiene hypothesis  the benefits of contact with a dog also include social support  as dogs cannot only provide companionship and social support themselves but also act as facilitators of social interactions between humans       one study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when accompanied by a dog than when they are not       in       a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood

of regional and traditional cuisines  given the range of diversity in soil type  climate  culture  ethnic groups  and occupations  these cuisines vary substantially from each other  using locally available spices  herbs  vegetables  and fruit  indian foodways have been influenced by religion  in particular hindu cultural choices and traditions       they have been also shaped by islamic rule  particularly that of the mughals  by the arrival of the portuguese on india s southwestern shores  and by british rule  these three influences are reflected  respectively  in the dishes of pilaf and

the deccan plateau and in rajasthan             the foundation of a typical indian meal is a cereal cooked in plain fashion  and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes       the latter includes lentils  pulses and vegetables spiced commonly with ginger and garlic  but also more discerningly with a combination of spices that may include coriander  cumin  turmeric  cinnamon  cardamon and

cultural histories of its adherents       the appearance of ahimsa  or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in indian history  especially upanishadic hinduism  buddhism and jainism  is thought to have been a notable factor in the prevalence of vegetarianism among a segment of india s hindu population  especially in southern india  gujarat  and the hindi speaking belt of north central india  as well as among jains       among these groups  strong discomfort is felt at thoughts of eating meat       and contributes to the low proportional consumption of meat to overall diet in india       unlike china  which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth  in india the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy  rather than meat  becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption accompanying higher economic growth        in the last millennium  the most significant import of cooking techniques into india occurred during the mughal empire  the cultivation of rice had spread much earlier from india to central and west asia  however  it was during mughal rule that dishes  such as the pilaf       developed in the interim during the abbasid caliphate       and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt  spread into northern india from regions to its northwest       to the simple yogurt marinade of persia  onions  garlic  almonds  and spices began to be added in india       rice grown to the southwest of the mughal capital
